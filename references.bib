  abstract = {Matching estimators for average treatment effects are widely used in evaluation research despite the fact that their large sample properties have not been established in many cases. The absence of formal results in this area may be partly due to the fact that standard asymptotic expansions do not apply to matching estimators with a fixed number of matches because such estimators are highly nonsmooth functionals of the data. In this article we develop new methods for analyzing the large sample properties of matching estimators and establish a number of new results. We focus on matching with replacement with a fixed number of matches. First, we show that matching esti-mators are not N 1/2-consistent in general and describe conditions under which matching estimators do attain N 1/2-consistency. Second, we show that even in settings where matching estimators are N 1/2-consistent, simple matching estimators with a fixed number of matches do not attain the semiparametric efficiency bound. Third, we provide a consistent estimator for the large sample variance that does not require consistent non-parametric estimation of unknown functions. Software for implementing these methods is available in Matlab, Stata, and R.},

We discuss the advantages of these methods and apply them to study the effects of Proposition 99, a large-scale tobacco control program that California implemented in 1988. We demonstrate that, following Proposition 99, tobacco consumption fell markedly in California relative to a comparable synthetic control region. We estimate that by the year 2000 annual per-capita cigarette sales in California were about 26 packs lower than what they would have been in the absence of Proposition 99. Using new inferential methods proposed in this article, we demonstrate the significance of our estimates. Given that many policy interventions and events of interest in social sciences take place at an aggregate level (countries, regions, cities, etc.) and affect a small number of aggregate units, the potential applicability of synthetic control methods to comparative case studies is very large, especially in situations where traditional regression methods are not appropriate. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Statistical Association.},

To demonstrate the methods proposed in this article, we apply them to the National Supported Work (NSW) data, originally analyzed in Lalonde (1986). We also carry out a small simulation study based on the NSW example. In this simulation study, a simple implementation of the bias-corrected matching estimator performs well compared to both simple matching estimators and to regression estimators in terms of bias, root-mean-squared-error,and coverage rates.

The synthetic control method provides a systematic way to choose comparison units in comparative case studies. This systematization opens the door to precise quantitative inference in small-sample comparative studies, without precluding the application of qualitative approaches. Borrowing the expression from Sidney Tarrow, the synthetic control method allows researchers to put "qualitative flesh on quantitative bones." We illustrate the main ideas behind the synthetic control method by estimating the economic impact of the 1990 German reunification on West Germany.},

  abstract = {In the context of growing concern with violence in Latin American and Caribbean cities this paper offers an analytical synthesis of urban securitisation which involves the construction of issues, spaces and populations as security threats. The synthesis contributes to debates on urban studies and critical security studies, which focus on neoliberalism as the driver of urban securitisation and militarisation as its main expression, by highlighting the embedded, contextualised and historically situated nature of securitisation and its multiple manifestations. The paper proposes a framework for the socio-spatial analysis of securitisation processes focusing on their causes, manifestations and consequences, while capturing their dialectic relation with cities' spatial characteristics. Bringing together Lefebvre's conceptualisation of the social production of space with Wacquant's analysis of the penal-assistential state, and using secondary sources complemented by primary data from our research, the paper shows that urban securitisation in this region is contingent to four socio-spatial dimensions common to Latin American and Caribbean cities {\textendash}segregation, territorial stigmatisation, overlapping insecurities and territorial struggles. Using a multidimensional framework, the paper illustrates how unaddressed legacies of colonialism and notions of state power in the context of struggles with criminal actors have driven urban securitisation and diversified its targets and techniques beyond militarisation. Under a securitising logic, programmes which often appear progressive are also shown to prejudice marginalised groups and undermine democratic values. The paper concludes with a call for further multidisciplinary analyses that account for the socio-spatial and historical particularities of contemporary forms of urban securitisation in this and other regions.},

  abstract = {We exploit differences in European mortality rates to estimate the effect of institutions on economic performance. Europeans adopted very different colonization policies in different colonies, with different associated institutions. In places where Europeans faced high mortality rates, they could not settle and were more likely to set up extractive institutions. These institutions persisted to the present. Exploiting differences in European mortality rates as an instrument for current institutions, we estimate large effects of institutions on income per capita. Once the effect of institutions is controlledfor, countries in Africa or those closer to the equator do not have lower incomes. (JEL 011, P16, P51) What are the fundamental causes of the large differences in income per capita across countries? Although there is still little consensus on the answer to this question, differences in institutions and property rights have received considerable attention in recent years. Countries with better "institutions," more secure property rights, and less distor-tionary policies will invest more in physical and human capital, and will use these factors more efficiently to achieve a greater level of income (e.g., Douglass C. North and Robert P. Thomas, 1973; Eric L. Jones, 1981; North, 1981). This view receives some support from crosscountry correlations between measures of property rights and economic development (e.g., Stephen Knack and Philip Keefer, 1995; Paulo Mauro, 1995; Robert E. Hall and Charles I. Jones, 1999; Dani Rodrik, 1999), and from a few micro studies that investigate the relationship between property rights and investment or output (e.g., Timothy Besley, 1995; Christopher Mazingo, 1999; Johnson et al., 1999). At some level it is obvious that institutions matter. Witness, for example, the divergent paths of North and South Korea, or East and West Germany, where one part of the country stagnated under central planning and collective ownership, while the other prospered with private property and a market economy. Nevertheless, we lack reliable estimates of the effect of institutions on economic performance. It is quite likely that rich economies choose or can afford better institutions. Perhaps more important, economies that are different for a variety of reasons will differ both},

We characterize how the presence of forceful agents interferes with information aggregation. Under the assumption that even forceful agents obtain some information from others, we first show that all beliefs converge to a stochastic consensus. Our main results quantify the extent of misinformation by providing bounds or exact results on the gap between the consensus value and the benchmark without forceful agents (where there is efficient information aggregation). The worst outcomes obtain when there are several forceful agents who update their beliefs only on the basis of information from individuals that have been influenced by them. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

We characterize pure strategy equilibria for arbitrary stochastic and deterministic social networks and characterize the conditions under which there will be asymptotic learning-convergence (in probability) to the right action as the social network becomes large. We show that when private beliefs are unbounded (meaning that the implied likelihood ratios are unbounded), there will be asymptotic learning as long as there is some minimal amount of "expansion in observations".

Under certain conditions, the controlled direct effect enables researchers to rule out competing explanations - an important objective for political scientists. To estimate the controlled direct effect without bias, we describe an easy-to-implement estimation strategy from the biostatistics literature. We extend this approach by deriving a consistent variance estimator and demonstrating how to conduct a sensitivity analysis. Two examples - one on ethnic fractionalization's effect on civil war and one on the impact of historical plough use on contemporary female political participation - illustrate the framework and methodology.},

  abstract = {This paper synthesises the state of knowledge on the economic effects of density. We consider 347 estimates of density elasticities of a broad range of outcomes ranging from wages, innovation, rents, various amenities, the cost of providing public services, transport- and environment-related outcomes to health and wellbeing. More than 100 of these estimates have not been previously published and have been provided by authors on request or inferred from published results in auxiliary analyses. We contribute original estimates of density elasticities of 16 distinct outcome variables that belong to categories where the evidence base is thin, inconsistent or non-existent. Along with a critical discussion of the quality and the quantity of the evidence base we present a set of recommended elasticities. Applying them to a scenario that roughly corresponds to an average high-income city, we find that density seems to be a net-amenity that is associated with positive external welfare effects. Densification policies may be welfare enhancing, but the distributional effects may be regressive, especially if residents are immobile and housing supply is inelastic.},

By following data outside the common trajectories of data circulation in the global North, this paper offers new geographical and data imaginations neglected by the universalised understandings of data and its political economy. Consequently, data's behaviour as a thing is thoroughly investigated in the ``follow the thing tradition'' by scrutinising data as a commodity, its meanings and its associations. Using actor-network-theory, the paper highlights data's open and contested character as well as the breakdowns throughout its journey. Following an uncirculated video via its traces sheds light on data's agency in evoking different assemblages and spatialities. It also reflects on the epistemological importance of not treating the Southern data as exceptional and calls for a theoretical landscape that does not leave many realities of data out in its homogenised universal narrative.},

  abstract = {Access to timely information on consumer spending is important to economic policymakers. The Census Bureau's monthly retail trade survey is a primary source for monitoring consumer spending nationally, but it is not well suited to study localized or shortlived economic shocks. Moreover, lags in the publication of the Census estimates and subsequent, sometimes large, revisions diminish its usefulness for real-time analysis. Expanding the Census survey to include higher frequencies and subnational detail would be costly and would add substantially to respondent burden. We take an alternative approach to fill these information gaps. Using anonymized transactions data from a large electronic payments technology company, we create daily estimates of retail spending at detailed geographies. Our daily estimates are available only a few days after the transactions occur, and the historical time series are available from 2010 to the present. When aggregated to the national level, the pattern of monthly growth rates is similar to the official Census statistics. We discuss two applications of these new data for economic analysis: First, we describe how our monthly spending estimates are useful for real-time monitoring of aggregate spending, especially during the government shutdown in 2019, when Census data were delayed and concerns about the economy spiked. Second, we show how the geographic detail allowed us quantify in real time the spending effects of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma in 2017.},

  abstract = {Debate about social-spatial ordering systems began as the opposition between planning and markets. This symposium discusses a related dichotomy: teleocracy (traditional directive planning) vs. nomocracy: social-spatial ordering by general-relational rules. This debate is not only theory; real institutional proposals and alternative practices demonstrate its practical relevance. In addition to the introduction, three contributions make up this volume. Why Nomocracy elaborates the case for nomocracy, claiming its superior effectiveness and morality. Only general relational rules can guide complex societies and enable spontaneous order in the face of structural ignorance, which defeats teleocratic projects and plans. Normatively, radical pluralism prescribes nomocracy as the preferred alternative to teleocracies that imply a particular vision of the "good society". Spatial planning rules and regulations distinguishes between planning as a government decision process and planning as a technical activity, emphasising the cyclical character of spatial planning processes and the technical autonomy of rules and regulation. Definitional analysis concludes that spatial planning is essentially nomocratic, with grids and rules determining cities' morphologies. Though'nomocracy' and 'teleocracy' may have some heuristic value, this dichotomy is not very helpful for planning practice. Towards a dialectic theory of planning proposes a synthesis that recognises nomocracy and teleocracy as complementary social ordering systems. An association between nomocracy and institutions, and between teleocracy and organisations was found, which has limited analytical value but offers useful normative rules. Whilst ideal types of planning seem associated with teleocracy or nomocracy, the real world demands both, suggesting contingent rules for adopting these modes in planning. Two points of general agreement are: -Nomocracy is the preferred social-spatial ordering approach for regulating complex self-organising systems - societies and cities - These concepts - nomocracy and teleocracy - have limited use for applied research and empirical analysis of planning practices. But the contributors disagree on definitions, leading to divergent normative conclusions: 1. Nomocracy should be the dominant social-spatial ordering system. State planning for other sectors should be limited to nomocratic instruments, defined as universal-general relational laws and rules. 2. Rule-based spatial planning can be viewed as a form of nomocracy, necessary for spatial expression of the polity's public interest. Such planning includes schematic spatial topologies (e.g. the urban grid) and regulative planning. 3. Nomocracy and teleocracy are complementary social-spatial orders. A planning subject should act as an institution when "planning for others", using nomocratic tools to promote common values; when "planning for itself" it should use teleocratic tools acting as an organisation to realise its goals. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Developing countries are seeking economic development-i.e., structural transformation-which is inclusive in the sense that it is broad-based and raises the income of all, especially the poor. Thus, inclusive economic growth requires steady or even falling income inequality if it is to maximise the growth of incomes at the lower end of the distribution. Yet, this is at odds with Simon Kuznets' hypothesis that economic development tends to put upward pressure on income inequality, at least initially and in the absence of countervailing policies. The book asks: What are the types or 'varieties' of structural transformation that have been experienced in developing countries? What inequality dynamics are associated with each variety of structural transformation? And what policies have been utilised to manage trade-offs between structural transformation, income inequality, and inclusive growth? The book answers these questions using a comparative case study approach, contrasting nine developing countries while employing a common analytical framework and a set of common datasets across the case studies. The intended intellectual contribution of the book is to provide a comparative analysis of the relationship between structural transformation, income inequality, and inclusive growth; to do so empirically at a regional and national level and to draw conclusions from the cases on the varieties of ST, their inequality dynamics, and the policies have been employed to mediate the developer's dilemma"--},

The fundamental normative motivation is to create effective measures that better reflect poor people's experience, so that policies using such measures reduce poverty. Such measures are needed because, empirically, income-poor households are (surprisingly) not well-matched to households carrying other basic deprivations like malnutrition; also the trends of income and non-income deprivations are not matched, and nor does growth ensure the reduction of social deprivations. And, a dashboard overlooks the interconnection between deprivations, which people experience and policies seek to address. Turning to policy, we close by discussing how the Alkire-Foster methodology we present in Working Paper 86 (``Multidimensional Poverty Measurement and Analysis: Chapter 5 {\textendash} The Alkire-Foster Counting Methology'') may be used.},

Fostered by the relevancy of a scientific characterization of cities and for the availability of an unprecedented amount of data, academics have recently immersed in this topic and one of the most striking and universal finding was the discovery of robust allometric scaling laws between several urban indicators and the population size. Despite that, most governmental reports and several academic works still ignore these nonlinearities by often analyzing the raw or the per capita value of urban indicators, a practice that actually makes the urban metrics biased towards small or large cities depending on whether we have super or sublinear allometries. By following the ideas of Bettencourt et al. [PLoS ONE 5 (2010) e13541], we account for this bias by evaluating the difference between the actual value of an urban indicator and the value expected by the allometry with the population size. We show that this scale-adjusted metric provides a more appropriate/informative summary of the evolution of urban indicators and reveals patterns that do not appear in the evolution of per capita values of indicators obtained from Brazilian cities. We also show that these scale-adjusted metrics are strongly correlated with their past values by a linear correspondence and that they also display crosscorrelations among themselves. Simple linear models account for 31\%-97\% of the observed variance in data and correctly reproduce the average of the scale-adjusted metric when grouping the cities in above and below the allometric laws. We further employ these models to forecast future values of urban indicators and, by visualizing the predicted changes, we verify the emergence of spatial clusters characterized by regions of the Brazilian territory where we expect an increase or a decrease in the values of urban indicators.

  abstract = {The built environment is responsible for significant use of final energy (62\%) and is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions (55\%). Achieving environmental goals, including climate change mitigation, requires comprehensive methodologies to accurately assess the impacts from this sector. Research to date focuses on either individual buildings or on the urban level (e.g., metropolitan regions). Robust and accurate methodologies have been developed to quantify environmental impacts at both scales. While methodologies overlap between the building and urban levels, assessment remains largely confined within each scale. At the building level, research focuses on materials, architectural design, operational systems, structural systems, construction, and analysis methods. At the urban scale, urban form, density, transportation, infrastructure, consumption, and analysis methods are the main research focuses. The paper presents the major findings at each scale. The work then argues for an expanded analysis framework to account for the interplay between the building and city level captured through a new impact category: induced impacts. This new framework is necessary to address actual patterns of construction (new buildings or retrofits within existing cities) and to quantify currently missing impacts. Based on the findings, a new methodology to capture induced impacts in the built environment is outlined. Finally, practical and policy implications are discussed. Inclusion of induced impacts is critical to achieve environmental objectives within the building sector and beyond.},

Accumulated infrastructural changes eventually become so substantial that they trigger a phase transition. Such transitions disrupt the prior conditions for economic activities and network interdependencies, requiring radically transformed production techniques, organizations and location patterns. The interplay of economic equilibria and structural changes requires a theoretical integration of the slow time scale of infrastructural change and the fast time scale of market equilibration. This paper presents a theory that encompasses both rapidly and slowly changing variables and illustrates how infrequent phase transitions caused four logistical revolutions in Europe over the past millennium.},

This study shows that durability varies considerably between Asian, European and North American cities, with mean life expectancies of buildings that range from below 20 years in Chinese cities to over 100 years in European cities such as Paris. Urban planning principles that focus on the slow and steady expansion of accessibility and density within a durable built environment are consistent with general economic equilibria, while avoiding the pitfalls of political planning of the markets for private goods.},

Three sites are considered which attracted settlers from vastly different economic segments of the urban population from the 2000s and onwards. A combination of geographical information system (GIS)-based analysis, evidence from a recent household survey, insights from a range of key informant interviews and field observations provide evidence for the dynamics of urban expansion and settlement consolidation. These dynamics wield significant pressure on ecologically sensitive areas, e.g. wetlands, riparian zones and coastal lagoons, which are transformed into housing development through drainage, landfilling, channelling of streams and construction of barriers. Encroachment upon ecologically sensitive areas is associated with intensifying flood hazards. Key impediments are identified for the preservation of ecologically sensitive areas within the specific urban governance context of Accra. Encroachment is not necessarily driven by poverty or low income; it occurs for several socio-economic situations. Governance and enforcement in planning need improvement. Such insights must inform efforts to promote more sustainable trajectories of urban expansion, allowing cities to accommodate rapidly growing populations while preserving ecologically sensitive areas and benefiting from crucial ecosystem services.},

We also introduce several metrics for key manifestations of sprawl. We present these metrics as well as actual calculations of these metrics for two cities: Bangkok and Minneapolis. A forthcoming paper will present similar results for a global sample of 120 cities.},

  abstract = {Our study of the expansion of a representative sample of 30 cities showed that 28 of them expanded more than 16-fold during the twentieth century. More generally, cities are now expanding at twice their population growth rates, on average, and now cover almost 0.5\% of the planet's land area. We created a new dataset comprising the universe of all 3646 named metropolitan agglomerations and cities that had populations in excess of 100,000 in the year 2000, their populations in that year, and their built-up area identified in the Mod500 map, currently the best of eight satellite-based global maps of urban land cover. Using this dataset, we estimated urban land cover in smaller cities and towns in all countries and calculated total urban land cover in every country in the year 2000. We then employed multiple regression models that could explain more than 90\% of the variations in our urban land cover estimates amongst countries. Then, using U.N. urban population projections in combination with three realistic density change scenarios based on our previous global and historical study of densities, we projected urban land cover in every country and world region from 2000 to 2050. According to our medium projection, urban land cover in developing countries will increase from 300,000km2 in 2000 to 770,000km2 in 2030 and to 1,200,000km2 in 2050. Containing this expansion is likely to fail. Minimal preparations for accommodating it - realistic projection of urban land needs, the extension of metropolitan boundaries, acquiring the rights-of-way for an arterial road grid that can carry infrastructure and public transport, and the selective protection of open space from incursion by formal and informal land development - are now in order. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In order to densify meaningfully in the coming decades, cities need to make room within their existing footprints to accommodate more people. In the absence of adequate room within their existing footprints, cities create more room through outward expansion, typically resulting in lower overall densities. We introduce a quantitative dimension to this process, focusing on the population added to a global stratified sample of 200 cities between 1990 and 2014. In three-quarters of the cities we studied, the areas built before 1990 gained population and thus densified significantly. On average, however, only one-quarter of the total population added to the 200 cities in the sample in the 1990-2014 period were accommodated within their 1990 urban footprints, while three-quarters were accommodated within their newly built expansion areas. That resulted in an overall decline in average urban densities during the 1990-2014 period despite the near-global, decades-old and rarely questioned consensus that urban expansion must be contained.},

These serve as a laboratory for the scaling analysis of a large set of urban indicators. The analysis shows that population size alone does not provide us enough information to describe or predict the state of a city as previously proposed, indicating that the expected scaling laws are not corroborated. We found that most urban indicators scale linearly with city size, regardless of the definition of the urban boundaries. However, when nonlinear correlations are present, the exponent fluctuates considerably.},

Participants are likely to enact protective barriers to avoid confronting personal responsibility for `bad' decisions. Drawing on examples from an in-depth interview study of postsecondary educational experiences, we examine a technique and set of questions that can move beyond these biographical research roadblocks. We argue that a highly structured and comprehensive, yet flexible interview guide is ideal for exploring this concept. This article also outlines two questions that can elicit biographical regret, particularly educational regret.

  abstract = {Estimating intergenerational mobility in developing countries is difficult because matched parent-child income records are rarely available and education is measured very coarsely. In particular, there are no established methods for comparing educational mobility for subsamples of the population when the education distribution is changing over time. We resolve these problems using new methods in partial identification and new administrative data, and study intergenerational mobility across groups and across space in India. Intergenerational mobility for the population as a whole has remained constant since liberalization, but cross-group changes have been substantial. Rising mobility among historically marginalized Scheduled Castes is almost exactly offset by declining intergenerational mobility among Muslims, a comparably sized group that has few constitutional protections. These findings contest the conventional wisdom that marginalized groups in India have been catching up on average. We also explore hetero-geneity across space, generating the first high-resolution geographic measures of inter-generational mobility across India, with results across 5600 rural subdistricts and 2300 cities and towns. On average, children are most successful at exiting the bottom of the distribution in places that are southern, urban, or have higher average education levels. * We are thankful for useful discussions with},

Simultaneously, businesses are advised to implement a circular economy (CE) to bring new opportunities. However, it is pertinent to mention that little attention has been given to assess the role of I4.0 in adopting the CE and servitisation in a fully integrated manner. This research fills this gap by developing a conceptual framework through a systematic literature review of 139 studies investigating the relationship between the I4.0, CE, and servitisation. This study identifies the impact of these variables on a firm's operational and financial performance (revenue stream, growth, and profitability). Our research findings advocate that adopting I4.0 technologies to the business and manufacturing model enables sustainability, energy and resource efficiency while enhancing performance and offering innovative products through smart services. Thus, firms must systematically adopt I4.0 technologies to support a CE model that creates value through servitisation. This study identifies the research gaps that are unexplored for practitioners and future researchers while providing insight into the role of I4.0 in implementing CE in the servitisation business model.},

Buyers compete by offering menus of nonexclusive contracts, so that the seller can privately trade with several buyers. In this setting, we show that an equilibrium exists under mild conditions and that aggregate equilibrium allocations are generically unique. Although the good for sale is divisible, in equilibrium the seller ends up trading her whole endowment or not trading at all. Trades take place at a price equal to the expected quality of the good, conditional on the seller being ready to trade at that price. Our model thus provides a novel strategic foundation for Akerlof's (1970) results. It also contrasts with competitive screening models in which contracts are assumed to be exclusive, as in Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976). Latent contracts that are issued but not traded in equilibrium play an important role in our analysis.},

  abstract = {This chapter focuses on the geographic dimensions of knowledge spillovers. The starting point comes from the economics of innovation and technological change. This tradition focused on the innovation production function however it was aspatial or insensitive to issues involving location and geography. However, empirical results hinted that knowledge production had a spatial dimension. Armed with a new theoretical understanding about the role and significance of knowledge spillovers and the manner in which they are localized, scholars began to estimate the knowledge production function with a spatial dimension. Location and geographic space have become key factors in explaining the determinants of innovation and technological change. The chapter also identifies new insights that have sought to penetrate the black box of geographic space by addressing a limitation inherent in the model of the knowledge production. These insights come from a rich tradition of analyzing the role of both localization and urbanization economies, by extending the focus to the organization of economic activity within a spatial dimension and examine how different organizational aspects influence economic performance. While the endogenous growth theory emphasizes the importance of investments in research and development and human capital, a research agenda needs to be mapped out identifying the role that investments in spillover conduits can make in generating economic growth. It may be that a mapping of the process by which new knowledge is created, externalized and commercialized, hold the key to providing the microeconomic linkages to endogenous macroeconomic growth. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Empirically, this work is based on a three-year qualitative investigation (2015{\textendash}2018) into the French policy plan for pesticide use reduction (Ecophyto). Drawing on the literature on categories and classifications, I show that making substitution a viable policy option relies primarily on categorization processes and on the establishment of clear distinctions. By shedding light on the specific type of administrative and technical intervention substi\- tution as a policy option requires, the aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the political dimension of transitions.},

Then, we compare both estimates to assess the reliability of the aggregated data. Concentration is a key driver of a portfolio credit risk and the HHI is a reliable standard for measuring concentration risk. Results for the Mexican banking system suggest that the estimated HHI based on aggregate data is a fairly good proxy for the actual concentration. This result suggests that aggregate data are useful to evaluate the underlying risk of the portfolio for regulatory purposes.},

Finally, using data for 1993 and 2011, we find that although majority of the income inequality in rural India is explained by within-district income difference in both years, over time the share of between-district differences has increased and they account for a third of the total increase in rural income inequality between 1993 and 2011.},

  abstract = {The servitisation of the built environment, through the implementation of product{\textendash}service systems, is considered a promising business strategy to achieve a circular economy transition. This servitisation faces a number of practical challenges, among them the technological readiness and effective integration and application of existing and emerging products, manufacturing processes, and digital monitoring and management tools. The research builds on targeted literature review, and on a research-through-design approach based on full-scale pilot projects developed in an ongoing feedback loop between researchers, planners, and industry partners representing both the demand and supply sides of the fa{\c c}ade industry in the Netherlands. The paper analyses the technical implementation challenges currently preventing the fa{\c c}ade industry from adopting performancebased contracts. It then proposes the roles that existing and emerging digital design and engineering technologies, manufacturing processes, and asset management systems can play in the development, implementation, and fulfilment of such contracts. The paper proposes a multi-stakeholder, systemic model for the development and application of fa{\c c}ade technologies capable of overcoming many of the technical implementation barriers to the delivery of performance-based contracts for integrated facades. From this it concludes that an effective development of building technologies should strategically align with the solving of economic and contractual challenges such as circularityreadiness, profitability, risk distribution, legal demarcation, performance monitoring, and residual value stewardship. The resulting framework provides a strategic and conceptual basis for the development of circularity-enabling fa{\c c}ade technologies, accounting for the diverse and sometimes conflicting interests of the multitude of stakeholders involved throughout a project's lifecycle. The framework aims to support planners, manufacturers, and builders accelerate the circular deep energy renovation of the built environment while also exploring new business opportunities.},

  abstract = {The sustainable development of cities is increasingly recognized as crucial to meeting collectively agreed sustainability goals at local, regional and global scales, and more broadly to securing human well-being worldwide. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include a goal on cities (Goal 11), with most other goals and targets have urban applications and multi scalar implications for their implementation. Further, the interdependencies {\textemdash} including synergies and trade-offs {\textemdash} among the various SDGs are greater in cities, presenting both challenges and opportunities. A systems approach is urgently needed in urban research and policy analysis, but such an approach rarely features in current analysis or urban decision-making for various reasons. This paper explores four questions: why a systems approach is necessary, what defines such an approach, why has this rarely been adopted in practice, and what can be done to promote its use. We argue that a systems approach can reveal unrecognized opportunities to maximize co-benefits and synergies, guide management of inevitable trade-offs, and therefore inform prioritisation and successful solutions. We present four key issues for the effective implementation of the SDGs and the New Urban Agenda, which emerged from UN Habitat III Conference, namely: (a) a radical redesign of the multilateral institutional setup on urban issues; (b) promoting regenerative culture, behaviour, and design; (c) exploring ways to finance a systems approach; and (d) a new and enhanced role for science in sustainable development. The latter issue could be addressed through Future Earth's Urban Knowledge-Action Network, which aims at co-designing and co-producing cutting-edge and actionable knowledge for sustainable cities bringing together researchers and urban decision-makers and practitioners.},

  abstract = {We review the theoretical links between growth and agglomeration. Growth, in the form of innovation, can be at the origin of catastrophic spatial agglomeration in a cumulative process {\`a} la Myrdal. One of the surprising features of the Krugman [Journal of Political Economy 99 (1991) 483-499] model, was that the introduction of partial labor mobility in a standard "new trade model" with trade costs could lead to catastrophic agglomeration. The growth analog to this result is that the introduction of endogenous growth in the same type of "new trade model" can lead to the same result. A difference with the labour mobility version is that the results are easier to derive from the analytical point of view in the endogenous growth version. We show that the relation between growth and agglomeration depends crucially on capital (human or physical) mobility between regions. The absence of capital mobility is at the heart of the possibility of spatial agglomeration with catastrophe. In addition, growth alters the process of location even without catastrophe. In particular, and contrary to the fundamentally static models of the New Economic Geography, spatial concentration of economic activities may be consistent with a process of delocation of firms towards poor regions. Finally, the presence of localized technology spillovers implies that spatial agglomeration is conducive to growth. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This paper presents gridded estimates of population at a resolution of 1 km along with two spatial renderings of urban areas{\textemdash}one based on the official tabulations of population and settlement types (i.e., statutory towns, outgrowths, and census towns) and the other on remotely-sensed measures of built-up land derived from the Global Human Settlement Layer. We also cross-classified the census data and the remotely-sensed data to construct a hybrid representation of the continuum of urban settlement. In their spatial detail, these materials go well beyond what has previously been available in the public domain, and thereby provide an empirical basis for comparison among competing conceptual models of urbanization.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Divergent views of the city and urban processes, suppressed within the Urban Goal, are, however, likely to become more explicit as attention shifts to implementation. Acknowledging the different theoretical traditions used to legitimize the new urban agenda is an overdue task. As this agenda develops post-2015, the adequacy of these forms of urban theory will become more contested around, among other concerns, the possibilities and limits of place-based policy, advocacy and activism; and ways of monitoring and evaluating processes of urban transformation along multiple axes of development.},

  abstract = {Disconnected urban street networks, which we call ``street-network sprawl,'' are strongly associated with increased vehicle travel, energy use and CO2 emissions, as shown by previous research in Europe and North America. In this paper, we provide the first systematic and globally commensurable measures of street-network sprawl based on graph-theoretic and geographic concepts. Using data on all 46 million km of mapped streets worldwide, we compute these measures for the entire Earth at the highest possible resolution. We generate a summary scalar measure for street-network sprawl, the Street-Network Disconnectedness index (SNDi), as well as a data-driven multidimensional classification that identifies eight empirical street-network types that span the spectrum of connectivity, from gridiron to dendritic (tree-like) and circuitous networks. Our qualitative validation shows that both the scalar and multidimensional measures are meaningfully comparable within and across countries, and successfully capture varied dimensions of walkability and urban development. We further show that in select high-income countries, our measures explain cross-sectional variation in household transportation decisions, and a one standard-deviation increase in SNDi is associated with an extra 0.25 standard deviations in cars owned per household. We aggregate our measures to the scale of countries, cities, and smaller geographies and describe patterns in street-network sprawl around the world. Latin America, Japan, South Korea, much of Europe, and North Africa stand out for their low levels of street-network sprawl, while the highest levels are found in south-east Asia, the United States, and the British Isles. Our calculations provide the foundation for future work to understand urban processes, predict future pathways of transportation energy consumption and emissions, and identify effective policy responses.},

We report on global, national, and city-level trends since 1975 in the street-network disconnectedness index (SNDi), based on every mapped node and edge in the world. Streets in new developments in 90\% of the 134 most populous countries have become less connected since 1975, while just 29\% show an improving trend since 2000. The same period saw a near doubling in the relative frequency of a street-network type characterized by high circuity, typical of gated communities. We identify persistence in street-network sprawl, indicative of path-dependent processes. Specifically, cities and countries with low connectivity in recent years also had relatively low preexisting connectivity in our earliest time period. We discuss implications for policy intervention in road building in new and expanding cities as a top priority for sustainable urban development.},

  abstract = {The voices of young adults (15- 24) ring faintly in the conversation around nature-based solutions (NBS), an absence that results in a lack of both procedural and distributive justice in the provision of such solutions. NBS clearly shape young adults {\textemdash} including their connections with nature, engagement in pro-environmental be\- haviours, and social and psychological health {\textemdash} but the dramatic reshaping of urban areas via rapid growth, densification, and technological innovation means today's young adults have fewer opportunities to benefit from NBS. In a potentially vicious cycle, this shortfall can result in a weakened sense of connection with nature, leading to less time spent in natural environments and fewer sustainable behaviours. Achieving justice for young adults requires understanding their preferences, clarifying relationships between NBS characteristics and use, and translating research into evidence-based design. This paper fills these gaps by summarising interdisciplinary knowledge regarding the impacts of contact with nature on the development and well-being of young adults; describing case studies conducted in formal parks located in Australia's largest cities of Sydney and Melbourne to clarify connections between our existing knowledge and the real-world provision of NBS; and applying these findings to develop an appraisal framework comprising three primary attributes {\textemdash} order, diversity, and seclusion and retreat {\textemdash} that supports the design and integration of urban greenspaces that uniquely benefit young adults' social development and mental health. Finally, we explore the framework's implementation, demonstrating its utility and flexibility for urban planners, municipal policymakers, and natural-resource managers seeking to advance intergenerational equity.},

This paper evaluates the method of randomisation and concludes that while the method of randomisation is the gold standard for description, and does uncover what is here called ``circumstantial causality'', it is not able to demonstrate generalised causality. Nor does it, in itself, lead to policy conclusions, as is often claimed by its advocates. To get to policy conclusions requires combining the findings of randomised experiments with human intuition, which, being founded in evolution, has innate strengths.

  abstract = {We first develop the network paradigm that is currently dominating the way we think about the internet and introduce varieties of social networking that are being fashioned in interactive web environments. This serves to ground our arguments about Web 2.0 technologies. These constitute ways in which users of web-based services can take on the role of producers as well as consumers of information that derive from such services with sharing becoming a dominant mode of adding value to such data. These developments are growing Web 2.0 from the ground up, enabling users to derive hitherto unknown, hidden and even new patterns and correlations in data that imply various kinds of social networking. We define crowdsourcing and crowdcasting as essential ways in which large groups of users come together to create data and to add value by sharing. This is highly applicable to new forms of mapping. We begin by noting that maps have become important services on the internet with non- proprietary services such as Google Maps being ways in which users can fashion their own functionality. We review various top-down and bottom-up strategies and then present our own contributions in the form of GMapCreator that lets users fashion new maps using Google Maps as a base. We have extended this into an archive of pointers to maps created by this software, which is called MapTube, and we demonstrate how it can be used in a variety of contexts to share map information, to put existing maps into a form that can be shared, and to create new maps from the bottom up using a combination of crowdcasting, crowdsourcing and traditional broadcasting. We conclude by arguing that these developments define a neogeography which is essentially mapping for the masses.},

Recent research, however, suggests that cities are complex systems that mainly grow from the bottom up, their size and shape following well-defined scaling laws that result from intense competition for space. An integrated theory of how cities evolve, linking urban economics and transportation behavior to developments in network science, allometric growth, and fractal geometry, is being slowly developed. This science provides new insights into the resource limits facing cities in terms of the meaning of density, compactness, and sprawl, and related questions of sustainability. It has the potential to enrich current approaches to city planning and replace traditional top-down strategies with realistic city plans that benefit all city dwellers.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of cities is being transformed by new approaches from the complexity sciences (Batty, 2005). Here we review progress, sketching the background beginning with the systems approach which treated systems as being organised from the top down to that which now dominates where systems are treated as evolving from the bottom up. The switch in thinking we describe is best pictured in the transition from thinking of 'cities as machines' to 'cities as organisms'. We first review developments in the dynamics of cities where the notion of equilibrium has been replaced by a veritable potpourri of different types such as chaos, catastrophes, and bifurcations. We then look at patterns and processes that give rise to morphologies that illustrate fractal patterns and self-similarity. We follow this with ideas about networks and interactions that sustain cities through their transport and then we show how such processes of movement and mobility can give rise to the diffusion and segregation of different spatial activities. In all these developments, ideas about scaling that relate size, shape and scale in space and time are evident and we thus sketch three scaling laws based on rank-size, allometry and gravitation that are central to our synthesis of how spatial processes give rise to physical morphologies. We conclude with notions about how these ideas are being embedded into models that have potential applications to inform policy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Unlike normally distributed attributes of the population, these urban elements often scale according to forces that determine large numbers of small elements and a small number of large ones. While many objects evolve from small to large, not all objects can be large as resources as well as physical limits determine the distribution of their sizes. The theory behind such size distributions is referred to as scaling and the shape of such distributions is quite well-defined by various power and exponential laws. As objects grow and evolve, or are even designed, their form changes qualitatively due to the forces of competition and the constraints on space. Here we explore these ideas for cities, neighbourhoods in towns, and buildings, specifically high buildings, revealing that there are both important differences as well as similarities in their form, function, and structure.},

We begin by defining what big means in terms of size and then introduce the 'three Vs' of big data - volume, velocity and variety - which relate to various other characteristics of such data sets. Big data, in fact, is changing our focus on what is important in cities and focusing our attention on much smaller time spans over which cities change. We describe how such data is captured and generated and extend our argument to traditional data which can also become big under certain conditions were it to be disaggregated or combined with other data. We illustrate diff erent types of big data and then illustrate its features using three examples involving movement and social media. We use these arguments as a prelude to the substance and the method of the papers included in this issue which focus on diff erent aspects of big data and the wider context in which the data and models are developed as part of the smart cities movement.},

This paper presents the first systematic attempt to create internationally comparable evidence showing how different countries perform in terms of geographic wage inequalities. We create cross-country comparable measures of spatial wage disparities between and within similarly-defined local labour market areas (LLMAs) for Canada, France, (West) Germany, the UK and the US since the 1970s, and assess their contribution to national inequality. By the end of the 2010s, spatial inequalities in LLMA mean wages are similar in Canada, France, Germany and the UK; the US exhibits the highest degree of spatial inequality. Over the study period, spatial inequalities have nearly doubled in all countries, except for France where spatial inequalities have fallen back to 1970s levels. Due to a concomitant increase in within-place inequality, the contribution of places in explaining national wage inequality has remained fairly constant over the 40-year study period, except in the UK where we document a significant increase. Whilst common global social, economic and technological shocks are important drivers of spatial inequality, this variation in levels and trends of spatial inequality opens the way to comparative research exploring the role of national institutions in mediating how global shocks translate into economic disparities between places.},

Counterfactual simulations of the model indicate that variation in returns to experience and differences in wage intercepts across location type are the most important mechanisms contributing to observed city size wage premia. Variation in returns to experience is more important for generating wage premia between large and small locations while differences in wage intercepts are more important for generating wage premia betwen medium and small locations. Sorting on unobserved ability within education group and differences in labor market search frictions and distributions of firm-worker match quality contribute little to observed city size wage premia. These conclusions hold for separate samples of high school and college graduates.},

Immigration shocks are the source of identifying variation across cities in changes to the relative supply of skilled versus unskilled labor.

The analysis relied on combining established frameworks applied to social and technical analysis, alongside that of the analysis of institutions and integrated planning. Scholars from development studies, planning and transport studies, architecture and engineering, anthropology, geography, political science and public administration were involved. Each provided conceptual and methodological approaches of value but with some proving more synergetic than others. Overall the process itself yielded considerable benefits for the joint research endeavour and confirmed the validity and additionality of interdisciplinarity in infrastructure research.},

  abstract = {Many countries have expressed an interest in the size, performance and motivation of the informal sector, especially where the informal sector provides the livelihood and employment for a critical segment of the population. Tis essay reviews recent literature, methodologies, and relevant Bank studies as a way to share information with country teams interested in expanding their knowledge of the informal sector and related policy debates. Research in a number of regions points to four main areas where development policy can be improved by taking the informal sector into account. First, improvements should be made along a continuum; the heterogeneity among informal frms points to different policy approaches for different types of frms. Second, there should be public-private collaboration on mutual reforms. Many efforts to improve frm performance focus on elements of the production function (labor skills, credit) while treating government mainly as a cost (taxes, cost of compliance with regulations). Yet research reveals that many characteristics of the public regime strongly influence the decisions of frms regarding informality. Tird, research indicates a strong relation between basic skills and labor outcomes, particularly in the informal sector, despite the sector's lower average returns. Research also indicates the benefts of targeted training programs. Business services programs have a decidedly mixed record, yet ongoing research is refning results on what works best. Fourth, informal trade is pervasive in developing countries and the networks developed in informal trade{\textemdash}wholesalers, credit suppliers and money-changers, transporters{\textemdash} are a strong presence in the informal sector. Yet these kinds of complex and nontransparent trading systems can be discouraging to foreign investors and can otherwise undermine trade policy and the international competitiveness of developing countries. Te paper concludes with recommendations.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the original intentions and modifications of Berlin's 19th-century urban development plan, particularly the different spatial configurations at the local level. The creation, adaptation and long-term impacts of the Hobrecht Plan of Berlin are assessed for urban design and planning principles used for urban expansion between 1862 and 1900. The 1862 `Development Plan for the Environs of Berlin' represents a cornerstone on which the inner city is built even to this day. Morphological analyses are used to describe design parameters and the associated design principles. The origins of ideas, spatial development and planning statements are examined in relation to each other based on written and drawn archival materials together with geographical information system-based plan analysis. Individual district plans and explanatory reports provide a basis for alternative interpretations of Hobrecht's Berlin in 19th-century urban expansion planning. The example of Berlin illustrates the emergence and transition of 19th-century urban structures, as well as the design principles underpinning morphological aspects of street networks, public space systems and block patterns. This analysis serves as a reference in the history of European planning paradigms and urban planning models in general. It highlights the contribution of small-scale urban development with a focus on squares and local patterns.},

Over the twentieth century, we find little evidence of convergence in town populations, despite the railroad network expanding further to connect nearly all towns.

This paper shows that the analogous result is not true in urban economies under appropriate modifications for this field. An open subset of economies where none of the modified rational expectations equilibria fully reveals private information is found. There are two important pieces. First, there can be information about a location known by a consumer who does not live in that location in equilibrium, and thus the equilibrium rent does not reflect this information. Second, if a consumer's utility depends only on information about their (endogenous) location of residence, perturbations of utility naturally do not incorporate information about other locations conditional on the consumer's location of residence. Existence of equilibrium is proved. Space can prevent housing prices from transmitting information from informed to uninformed households, resulting in an inefficient outcome. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {With urban population increasing dramatically worldwide, cities are playing an increasingly critical role in human societies and the sustainability of the planet. An obstacle to effective policy is the lack of meaningful urban metrics based on a quantitative understanding of cities. Typically, linear per capita indicators are used to characterize and rank cities. However, these implicitly ignore the fundamental role of nonlinear agglomeration integral to the life history of cities. As such, per capita indicators conflate general nonlinear effects, common to all cities, with local dynamics, specific to each city, failing to provide direct measures of the impact of local events and policy. Agglomeration nonlinearities are explicitly manifested by the superlinear power law scaling of most urban socioeconomic indicators with population size, all with similar exponents ({\textasciitilde}1.15). As a result larger cities are disproportionally the centers of innovation, wealth and crime, all to approximately the same degree. We use these general urban laws to develop new urban metrics that disentangle dynamics at different scales and provide true measures of local urban performance. New rankings of cities and a novel and simpler perspective on urban systems emerge. We find that local urban dynamics display long-term memory, so cities under or outperforming their size expectation maintain such (dis)advantage for decades. Spatiotemporal correlation analyses reveal a novel functional taxonomy of U.S. metropolitan areas that is generally not organized geographically but based instead on common local economic models, innovation strategies and patterns of crime. {\textcopyright} 2010 Bettencourt et al.},

  abstract = {Despite the increasing importance of cities in human societies, our ability to understand them scientifically and manage them in practice has remained limited. The greatest difficulties to any scientific approach to cities have resulted from their many interdependent facets, as social, economic, infrastructural, and spatial complex systems that exist in similar but changing forms over a huge range of scales. Here, I show how all cities may evolve according to a small set of basic principles that operate locally. A theoretical framework was developed to predict the average social, spatial, and infrastructural properties of cities as a set of scaling relations that apply to all urban systems. Confirmation of these predictions was observed for thousands of cities worldwide, from many urban systems at different levels of development. Measures of urban efficiency, capturing the balance between socioeconomic outputs and infrastructural costs, were shown to be independent of city size and might be a useful means to evaluate urban planning strategies. C ities exist, in recognizable but changing forms, over an enormous range of scales (1), from small towns with just a few people to the gigantic metropolis of Tokyo, with more than 35 million inhabitants. Many parallels have been suggested between cities and other complex systems, from river networks (2) and biological organisms (3-6) to insect colonies (1, 7) and ecosystems (8). The central flaw of all these arguments is their emphasis on analogies of form rather than function, which limit their ability to help us understand and plan cities. Recently, our increasing ability to collect and share data on many aspects of urban life has begun to supply us with better clues to the properties of cities, in terms of general statistical patterns of land use, urban infrastructure, and rates of socioeconomic activity (6, 9-13). These empirical observations have been summarized across several disciplines, from geography to economics , in terms of how different urban quantities (such as the area of roads or wages paid) depend on city size, usually measured by its population , N. The evidence from many empirical studies over the past 40 years points to there being no special size to cities, so that most urban properties , Y, vary continuously with population size and are well described mathematically on average by power-law scaling relations of the form Y {$\frac{1}{4}$} Y 0 N b ; where Y 0 and b are constants in N. The surprise, perhaps, is that cities of different sizes do have very different properties. Specifically , one generally observes that rates of social quantities (such as wages or new inventions) increase per capita with city size (11, 12) (super-linear scaling, b {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1 {\th} d {$>$} 1; with d {$\simeq$} 0:15), whereas the volume occupied by urban infrastructure per capita (roads, cables, etc.) decreases (sublinear scaling, b {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1 - d {$<$} 1) (Fig. 1). Thus, these data summarize familiar expectations that larger cities are not only more expensive and congested, but also more exciting and creative when compared to small towns. These empirical results also suggest that, despite their apparent complexity, cities may actually be quite simple: Their average global properties may be set by just a few key parameters (12, 13). However, the origin of these observed scaling relations and an explanation for the interdependences between spatial, infrastructural, and social facets of the city have remained a mystery. Here, I develop a unified and quantitative framework to understand, at a theoretical level, how cities operate and how these interdepen-dencies arise. Consider first the simplest model of a city with circumscribing land area A and Fig. 1. Scaling of urban infrastructure and socioeconomic output. (A) Total lane miles (volume) of roads in U.S. metropolitan areas (MSAs) in 2006 (blue dots). Data for 415 urban areas were obtained from the Office of Highway Policy Information from the Federal Highway Administration (14). Lines show the best fit to a scaling relation Y(N) = Y 0 N b (red), with b = 0:849 T 0:038 [95\% confidence interval (CI), R 2 = 0.65]; the theoretical prediction, b = 5/6 (yellow); and linear scaling b = 1 (black). (B) Gross metropolitan product of MSAs in 2006 (green dots). Data obtained for 363 MSAs from U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (14). Lines describe best fit (red) to data, b = 1.126 T 0.023 (95\% CI, R 2 = 0.96); the theoretical prediction, b = 7/6 (yellow); and proportional scaling, b = 1 (black). The two best-fit parameters in each scaling relation were estimated by means of ordinary least-squares minimization to the linear relation between logarithmically transformed variables (14). The inset shows the estimate of G for 313 U.S. MSAs and the conservation law d ln G d ln N = 0 (R 2 = 0:003). G is measured as the product of gross domestic product and road volume, both per capita. As predicted by the theory, observed values of G for different cities cluster around its most likely value (mode, yellow line), which gives an estimate of the optimum G {\~A} , and are bounded by the maximum G max {$\simeq$} 8G {\~A} (green line); see also Fig. 2B. Several metropolitan areas, such as Bridgeport, Connecticut (green circle); Riverside, California (yellow circle); or Brownsville, Texas (red circle), are outliers, suggesting that they are suboptimal in terms of their transportation efficiency or amount of social mixing.},

Recently, attempts to formalize mathematically these expectations have led to the hypothesis of urban scaling, namely that certain properties of all cities change, on average, with their size in predictable scale-invariant ways. The emergence of these scaling relations depends on a few general properties of cities as social networks, co-located in space and time, that conceivably apply to a wide range of human settlements. Here, we discuss the present evidence for the hypothesis of urban scaling, some of the methodological issues dealing with proxy measurements and units of analysis and place these findings in the context of other theories of cities and urban systems. We show that a large body of evidence about the scaling properties of cities indicates, in analogy to other complex systems, that they cannot be treated as extensive systems and discuss the consequences of these results for an emerging statistical theory of cities.},

Using new harmonized definitions for functional urban areas, we examine to what extent these ideas apply to European cities. We show that while most large urban systems in Western Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK) approximately agree with theoretical expectations, the small number of cities in each nation and their natural variability preclude drawing strong conclusions. We demonstrate how this problem can be overcome so that cities from different urban systems can be pooled together to construct larger datasets. This leads to a simple statistical procedure to identify urban scaling relations, which then clearly emerge as a property of European cities.We compare the predictions of urban scaling to Zipf's law for the size distribution of cities and show that while the former holds well the latter is a poor descriptor of European cities. We conclude with scenarios for the size and properties of future pan-European megacities and their implications for the economic productivity, technological sophistication and regional inequalities of an integrated European urban system.},

The observation of scale invariance over some range identifies general system types, be they ideal gases, ecosystems or cities. The use of scaling in the analysis of cities quantifies many of their arguably fundamental general characteristics, especially their capacity to create interrelated economies of scale in infrastructure and increasing returns to scale in socio-economic activities. However, the measurement of these effects, and the relationship of observable parameters to theory, hinge on how scaling analysis is used empirically. Here, we show how two equivalent approaches to urban scaling{\textemdash}cross-sectional and temporal{\textemdash}lead to the measurement of different mixtures of the same fundamental parameters describing pure scale and pure temporal phenomena. Specifically, temporal exponents are sensitive to the intensive growth of urban quantities and to circumstances when population growth vanishes, leading to instabilities and infinite divergences. These spurious effects are avoided in cross-sectional scaling, which is more common and closer to theory in terms of quantitative testable expectations for its parameters.},

Using analytical and geospatial data on the evictions that took place in this period, this paper seeks to answer some key questions and argues in support of policies that favour in situ upgrading over resettlement. The political challenges to this are discussed, particularly in the light of findings that evictions occur with similar intensity regardless of which political party is in power.},

The essay then offers a first set of shared characteristics that may enable us to think of a practice as ``Southern'', and urges the expansion of a vocabulary of Southern urban practice.},

In reviewing the literature on remittances, this survey shows that to fully estimate the role of remittances as a lifeline for developing countries the two above recent phenomena cannot be ignored. Indeed, using an original dataset on bilateral remittances and estimating a gravity model in which the gender and the skill dimensions of the migrants are taken into account, we find that both are positively associated with annual remittances received by origin countries. In particular, the main effect seems to be driven by skilled female migrants which presumably represent an important loss in terms of human capital in the perspective of a developing country.},

We unpack the political channels that link residential segregation with access to public services. `Micro-segregation', or neighbourhood residential sorting within a ward (the elementary administrative and political unit in urban India), enables segregated neighbourhoods to better organise and petition public services. Political competition further amplifies these demands from segregated neighbourhoods. The state's response to such demand is, however, modulated by both in-group favouritism and outgroup discrimination. States' ability to indulge in such favouritism and discrimination is in turn contingent on how the caste composition of a ward is different from that of the city as a whole {\textendash} `macro-segregation'. We combine large-scale quantitative analysis using neighbourhood-level national census data for all towns in India with at least 0.3 million residents, and multi-year qualitative fieldwork in Bengaluru, a metropolis of over 10 million residents, to delineate the interactions between these demandside and supply-side channels. While macro-segregation is negatively associated with piped water and sewerage, micro-segregation has a positive association.},

First, I combine data from wealth surveys (NSS-AIDIS) and millionaire lists to produce wealth inequality series for India over the 1961-2012 period. I find a strong rise in wealth concentration in recent decades, in line with recent research using income data. E.g. the top 10\% wealth share rose from 45\% in year 1981 to 68\% in 2012, while the top 1\% share rose from 27\% to 41\%. Next, I gather information from censuses and surveys (NSS AIDIS and consumption, IHDS, NFHS) in order to explore the changing relationship between class and caste in India and the mechanisms behind rising inequality. Assortative mating appears to be very high in India, both at the caste level and at the education level (though not hugely larger than than in Western countries at the education level). I stress the limits of our knowledge and indicate possible lines of future research, particularly regarding the interplay between assortative mating and inequality dynamics.

  abstract = {This paper is centred on using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to investigate the spatial variability in the factors which influence rail demand patterns in the Sydney region of New South Wales, and to explicitly incorporate these variations in the demand forecasting process. It explores whether allowing spatial parameter variability to be included in demand models enhances their explanatory power and improves their forecasting capability. The paper firstly reviews the different methodologies in use for estimating and forecasting demand, both in the Sydney region and elsewhere around the world. Against this background the methodology of GWR is explained, identifying the key differences in both inputs and outputs of a GWR based model. The paper then describes the development of 'conventional' global regression models of rail demand in the Sydney region, and reports on the recalibration of the most successful model using GWR. A large number of explanatory variables are tested in the models, including catchment population and employment, household size, income and age profile, car ownership levels, train frequency, bus interchange potential, bicycle storage provision and distance to the city centre. The results from the global and GWR models are then compared, with the significance of the spatial variation in the GWR models tested using an AICc-based criterion. This comparison informs a discussion of the extent to which modelling spatial parameter variation contributes to a better understanding of rail demand and its forecasting. The discussion concludes by identifying the relative merits of the developed GWR models as compared to other models for forecasting rail travel.},

It brings together scholars from diverse schools working on new areas of research and application in urban design and planning. Emergent research agendas include both novel areas of research and important shifts in the direction of a research area. The challenge for planning schools is to reflect critically on these changes and develop long-term research agendas that can better position our field in society and academia, and provide a basis from which to assess our academic programmes. The chapters in this issue display the different scales and fields of planning, including planning for: disaster recovery; climate change, especially opportunities for mitigation; shrinking cities in the First World; and rapidly urbanising informal and impoverished cities in the global South. At the same time, the chapters identify research areas that respond to major social and environmental changes. Olshansky and Chang highlight the increasing losses from catastrophic disasters, and address the need for disaster recovery planning. Wheeler, Randolph and London focus on climate change, and, noting the urgency of action now, their research agenda emphasises opportunities for planners to develop research and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hollander, Pallagst, Schwarz and Popper look at increasing economic and population trends in many First World cities that result in city 'shrinkage'. They present new opportunities for improving cities' green space networks and natural features, and for research. The trebling of urban population in African cities by 2050, in conditions of poverty and informality, is the major trend driving Parnell, Pietriese and Watson's chapter. They present an agenda for new planning theories and for supporting empirical research to address the actual conditions of African cities. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {There is an increased interest in applying nature for addressing various urban challenges, such as those related to air pollution, climate change, and health, but the economic value of urban nature is not always well recognized. In this study we present a meta-analysis of a rapidly expanding literature that applied stated preference valuation methods to value green and blue urban nature in a variety of contexts. We estimate value transfer functions based on 60 primary studies that elicited urban nature values from in total more than 41,000 respondents worldwide. Moreover, we obtain insights into the main determinants of values of urban nature, in terms of study and methodological characteristics, types of nature, and ecosystem services. For example, using global and European value functions, estimates of the average value of an urban park vary between 12,000USD and 33,100USD, respectively, while estimates of the average value of urban forest vary between 3,000USD and 2,250USD, respectively. We apply these value transfer functions to natural interventions in several cities in Europe, illustrating how these functions can be used for estimating the value of specific natural areas in a variety of urban settings.},

Between 1874 and 1912, all the former private railway companies in India were taken over by the colonial Government at predetermined dates set by contracts negotiated in the 1850s. Exploiting changes in ownership within the same railway systems, we find the move to state ownership decreased operating costs by 14 percent. We do not find any evidence of biases associated with anticipation effects by private companies. In contrast, we argue the regulatory environment of providing 5 percent guarantees to private companies, weak oversight of private companies and a colonial state with strong fiscal incentives all contributed to improved performance under state ownership. Our findings have implications for leading issues discussed in the literature on ownership and regulation in developing countries.},

We find that a location's physical geography characteristics are the dominant determinants of its urban chances. Preferential location for water- or land-based transportation is a particularly important city seed. In addition, a location's position relative to already-existing cities matters for its urban chances. Interestingly, it does so in a way corresponding to predictions from economic geography theory.},

  abstract = {That the market economy inevitably leads to inequality is widely accepted today, with disagreement confined to the desirability of redistributive action, its extent, and the role of government in the process. The canonical text of liberal political economy, Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, is assumed even in the most progressive interpretations to accept inequality, rationalized as the inevitable trade-off for increasing prosperity compared to less developed but more equal economies. I argue instead that Smith's system, if fully implemented, would not allow steep inequalities to arise. In Smith, profits should be low and labor wages high, legislation in favor of the worker is ``always just and equitable,'' land should be distributed widely and evenly, inheritance laws liberalized, taxation can be high if it is equitable, and the science of the legislator is necessary to put the system in motion and keep it aligned. Market economies are made in Smith's system. Political theorists and economists have highlighted some of these points, but the counterfactual ``what would the distribution of wealth be if all the building blocks were ever in place?'' has not been posed. Doing so encourages us to question why steep inequality is accepted as a fact, instead of a pathology that the market economy was not supposed to generate in the first place.},

  abstract = {Studies of social movements generally focus on the mechanisms through which movements affect the political will of states. Much of this research, in turn, implicitly assumes that the state has the capacity to realize the decisions adopted as a result of movement action. Focusing on local governments in young democracies, this article examines whether and how state capacities contribute to movement-initiated policy change and associ\- ated delivery in the sphere of housing and land use. It analyzes contrasting cases of local state capacities using a paired ``most-similar'' comparison of two megacities of the Global South, each of which underwent transitions to democracy in the past three decades: Sa{\texttildelow}o Paulo, Brazil, and Johannesburg, South Africa. In S{\texttildelow}ao Paulo, state capacities facilitated policy success. These capacities were developed through interactions between movements and key bureaucratic allies. In Johannesburg, by contrast, the local bureaucracy became both impervious to movement pressure and unable to counter strategies by business elites to weaken efforts at policy reform. State capacity in this case hindered reforms. As a result, in S{\texttildelow}ao Paulo, sequential, reinforcing feedback loops of citywide movement mobilization and formal policy reforms took shape. In Johannesburg, lack of openness of the state to civil society led grassroots movement organizations to refrain from city-wide policy reform efforts and to increasingly organize their activity at the neighborhood and street levels.},

The growth of cities is typically associated with increases in socioeconomic productivity, but it also creates strong inequalities. Despite a growing body of evidence characterizing these heterogeneities in developed urban areas, not much is known systematically about their most extreme forms in developing cities and their consequences for sustainability. Here, we characterize the general patterns of income and access to services in a large number of developing cities, with an emphasis on an extensive, high-resolution analysis of the urban areas of Brazil and South Africa. We use detailed census data to construct sustainable development indices in hundreds of thousands of neighborhoods and show that their statistics are scale-dependent and point to the critical role of large cities in creating higher average incomes and greater access to services within their national context. We then quantify the general statistical trajectory toward universal basic service provision at different scales to show that it is characterized by varying levels of inequality, with initial increases in access being typically accompanied by growing disparities over characteristic spatial scales. These results demonstrate how extensions of these methods to other goals and data can be used over time and space to produce a simple but general quantitative assessment of progress toward internationally agreed sustainable development goals.},

Nonetheless, economists also recognize the production advantages of urban density in the form of positive agglomeration externalities.

Therefore, I develop a spatial equilibrium model of urban structure that includes both congestion costs and agglomeration externalities. I then estimate the structural parameters of the model using a computational algorithm to match the spatial distribution of employment, population, land use, land rents, and commute times in the data. Policy simulations based on the estimates suggest that congestion pricing may have ambiguous consequences for economic welfare.},

  abstract = {Most cities enjoy some autonomy over how they tax their residents, and that autonomy is typically exercised by multiple municipal governments within a given city. In this chapter, we document patterns of city-level taxation across countries, and we review the literature on a number of salient features affecting local tax setting in an urban context. In OECD countries, urban local governments on average raise some 10\% of total tax revenue, and in non-OECD countries, they raise around half that share. We show that most cities are highly fragmented: urban areas with more than 500,000 inhabitants are divided into 74 local jurisdictions on average. The vast majority of these cities are characterized by a central municipality that strongly dominates the remaining jurisdictions in terms of population. These empirical regularities imply that analyses of urban taxation need to take account of three particular features: interdependence among tax-setting authorities (horizontally and vertically), jurisdictional size asymmetries, and the potential for agglomeration economies. We survey the relevant theoretical and empirical literatures, focusing in particular on models of asymmetric tax competition, of taxation and income sorting, and of taxation in the presence of agglomeration rents.},

  abstract = {Background: Personal transportation in urban areas is characterised by different transportation technologies with significantly varying properties regarding usability, infrastructural requirements and environmental impacts. This characterisation motivates the objective evaluation of mobility solutions, based on different criteria. State of the art evaluations in the scientific literature mainly focus on one specific criterion at a time. The most common criteria investigated are found in energy demand or equivalent fuel consumption. Other parameters include the traffic space demand or mean velocity as a reference for the user-related criterion ``travel time''. Since different modes of transport show various potentials in different criteria, an interesting point for scientific research is consideration of the different criteria in a more comprehensive evaluation approach. To address this issue, the aim of this study is to present a new approach for an objective evaluation and comparison of different transport technologies under consideration of pre-defined range of criteria and defined boundary conditions and requirements for personal mobility in cities. Besides technical-oriented aspects like driving range, transport capability and life cycle-related consumption of resources, additional factors influencing user-behaviour and traffic density are reflected. The evaluation method is presented, based on a generated exemplary data collection regarding technical and in-use characteristics of different modes of transport, mainly investigated in the city of Graz, Austria. Methods: The study focuses on different means of transport, in particular walking, bicycling, the use of powered two-wheelers, passenger cars with different propulsion systems and public transport systems. It is based on the determination of selected criteria, considering ecologic, infrastructural and user-related aspects. With respect to ecologic criteria, the study considers resources and energy consumption as also the resulting CO2 equivalent emissions. The mean velocity and transport capacity are considered in the context of user-related criteria. Traffic space demand is an important and limited resource, especially in urban areas. The present study thus includes the determination and comparison of the relative traffic and parking space demands for the different modes of transport. The evaluation is based on a specifically developed evaluation methodology, considering weighted traffic performance indices, which are also proposed and discussed. Results: Within the present study, a database providing specific mobility-related criteria and parameters has been generated, representing technical characteristics and the effects of the use of different vehicles and means of transportation in urban areas. The illustrated results allow an objective evaluation of a broad range of different means of transportation and vehicles, based on introduced ``weighted traffic performance indices'' (WTPI). Conclusions: The study contributes to a discussion of transportation technologies and allows a derivation of measures for further research topics to face future intra-urban mobility demands. This represents a basis for decision making on the priorisation of the most suitable transport systems for urban areas. It is shown that the motorised individual passenger transport as dominated by the use of private passenger cars in particular represents today the most inefficient form of inner-urban mobility.},

In this article, we review the expanding body of economic research on developing-world cities. One strand of this literature emphasizes the economic benefits of urban connection, typically finding that agglomeration benefits are at least as high in poor countries as they are in rich countries. Yet there remains an ongoing debate about whether slums provide a path to prosperity or an economic dead end. A second strand of research analyzes the negative externalities associated with urban density, and the challenges of building and maintaining infrastructure to moderate those harms. Researchers are just beginning to understand the links between institutions (such as public-private partnerships), incentives (such as congestion pricing), and the effectiveness of infrastructure spending in addressing urban problems. A third line of research addresses the spatial structure of cities directly with formal, structural models. These structural models seem particularly valuable when analyzing land-use and transportation systems in the far more fluid cities of the developing world.},

At the heart of this debate lies a question about the degree and type of autonomy that towns and cities might have in shaping their economic, environmental, social and cultural geography. This paper aims to examine this question. Starting with the premise that the degree of autonomy any particular town or city has is inherently an empirical question {\textendash} one which can only be conceptualised in relational terms vis-{\`a}-vis the distributed, networked and territorialised responsibilities and powers of the city and the nation-state and other zones of connection {\textendash} we examine four different contexts where debates over autonomy have intensified in recent history (Brazil, UK, India and South Africa). Drawing on recent respective histories, we identify key elements and enablers in the making of urban autonomy: a characteristic that exists in a variety of guises and forms and creates a patchwork landscape of differentially powerful fragments. We reveal how, beyond its characteristic as a political ideal, autonomy surfaces as a practice that emerges from within specific sectors of particular societies and through their relationship with national and regional politics. Four alternative forms of urban autonomy are delineated: fragmented, coerced (or enclave), distributed and networked. We contend that the spatial templates for autonomy are not predetermined but can be enhanced in multiple different sites and forms of political space within the city. This enhancement appears essential for the integration and strengthening of capacities for sustainable and just forms of development throughout the urban.},

There is a clear philosophy, a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a "savvy" prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used. Various facets of such multimodel inference are presented here, particularly methods of model averaging.},

More specifically, likely benefits include improved public transport, reduced social segregation and better access to facilities, while the main problems are likely to be reduced living space and a lack of affordable housing. Investigations of different aspects of density show that the cities that most support social equity appear to be those that have a large proportion of high-density housing.},

  abstract = {Cities are under intensifying pressure to respond to climate change and growing social inequities. Integrating nature-based solutions, as part of essential city infrastructure, contributes to resilient, liveable and equitable cities, as well as provision of biodiversity habitat. There is increasing focus on how concepts of justice can be embedded in these planning and governance processes. This paper proposes a framework to inform planning for just nature-based cities. It brings together concepts of just city, environmental and climate justice and more-thanhuman thinking, with research on urban nature-based solutions. It highlights the centrality of epistemic justice, and the importance of Traditional Ecological Knowledge in just nature-based city planning and governance. The just nature-based city framework is applied to the case study of the Yarra River (Melbourne, Australia). In 2017, the Yarra River Protection (Wilip-gin Birrarung murron) Act, the first legislation in Australia to be co-titled in the Traditional Owners' language, legally recognised the river as a single living and integrated natural entity. Applying the just nature-based city framework, we find that there are both opportunities and challenges in this new approach to planning. While the Act and associated programs represent substantial and innovative ad\- vances, their scope is limited by exclusion of key policy domains and a focus on waterway corridor rather than catchment. The paper concludes by reinforcing the importance of a broadened understanding of justice, that spans both human and non-human considerations, and foregrounds Traditional Owners' perspectives and as\- pirations in designing, planning and governing just nature-based cities.},

I argue that peripheral urbanization refers to modes of the production of space that (a) operate with a specific temporality and agency, (b) engage transversally with official logics, (c) generate new modes of politics, and (d) create highly unequal and heterogeneous cities. I also argue that peripheral urbanization not only produces heterogeneity within the city as it unfolds over time, but also varies considerably from one city to another. I build my arguments by juxtaposing dissimilar cases from a few cities in the global south. To focus on peripheral urbanization means simultaneously to de-center urban theory and to offer a bold characterization of modes of the production of space that are different from those that generated the cities of the North Atlantic.},

We discuss alternative, typically stronger, assumptions that alleviate these challenges. We also provide a variety of treatment effect decomposition results, highlighting that parameters associated with popular linear two-way fixed-effect (TWFE) specifications can be hard to interpret, even when there are only two time periods. We introduce alternative estimation procedures that do not suffer from these TWFE drawbacks, and show in an application that they can lead to different conclusions.},

Anecdotal and quantitative evidence suggest that a large shadow market for knowledge has already formed among cities around the world. Case observations reviewed here suggest that the best learners are deliberate and systematic, finding or creating new knowledge, converting it to use, and storing learning experiences that draw on collective memory. Acquired knowledge resides in two main forms: one is hard data, stored in documents, computers, or specialized units of government. Another is soft data stored in professional and social networks that link a wide array of actors in the community-not just staff in the city bureaucracy. The analysis leads to a number of propositions that deserve attention and testing: several kinds of learning systems can be observed, that the process of learning may be as important as the product in contributing to competitiveness, that policies can helpful to facilitate learning, and that a radical departure from customary policy, especially in donor institutions, may be needed to effectively meet requirements of institutional capacity building in cities of the developing world. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Before the existence of a monetary system, taxes were paid by a percentage of crops raised. Through most of history, the tax assessor and the tax col- lector were the same person; therefore, ``tax collector'' is used interchangeably with ``tax assessor'' throughout the following paper. Some of the most common forms of taxation over the millennia were poll taxes, tariffs on goods, and property taxes on the value of land, build- ings, and other personal property. The purpose of this paper is to present some of the major moments in the history of real and personal property taxation. Let's take a short walk through time to understand what we have in common with our ancestor assessors, what we can learn from them, and how developed the current property tax system has come to be.

The main contribution of the paper is to show how differentiated effects of urban primacy on economic growth can be accounted for by considering a role for the quality of the urban environment (in terms of urban infrastructure). The role of urban infrastructure is found to be robust to a long list of controls, different specifications, different estimation techniques, and potential bias from simultaneity and measurement error.},

However, extant research falls short in terms of explaining how companies design their business model according to the circular economy principles.

  abstract = {Traditionally, inequality measurements have been designed only for non-spatial applications, despite the argument that inequality is manifested in social space (and may be perceived spatially). Presented here is an approach to understanding urban inequality in terms of the spatial distribution of population and income. This is done with a general definition of spatial disparity (implying significant differences between neighbouring parcels); spatial disparity exists between contiguous parcels even when similar values are spatially clustered (as in the case of income). A family of spatial disparity measures is proposed: the basic measure of 'neighbourhood disparity' uses information on contiguity to arrive at individual disparity values for individual parcels, and an indexed value for an area. The process of neighbour identification is made simpler by using topologically structured spatial databases used in vector-based GIS. This methodology is used on 1990 census data to analyse disparities in the spatial distribution of income in Philadelphia to illustrate and compare the use, the basic measure and its weighted versions, and to identify and map general patterns of urban spatial income disparity. It is found that spatial income disparity is manifested in rings around the CBD, and that the distribution of black incomes is very heterogeneous (although the generalisability of both conclusions may be questioned).},

We start by providing some background on the design features of mortgage contracts that distinguish them from other loans and that have important implications for issues presented in the rest of the chapter. We then explain how mortgage finance interacts with public policy, particularly tax policy, to influence a household's decision to own or rent and how shifts in the demand for owner-occupied housing are translated into housing prices and quantities, given the unusual nature of housing supply. We consider the distribution of mortgage credit in terms of access and price, by race, ethnicity, and income, and over the life cycle, with particular attention to the role of recent innovations such as nonprime mortgage securitization and reverse mortgages. The extent of negative equity has been unprecedented in the past decade, and we discuss its impact on strategic default, housing turnover, and housing investment. We describe spatial patterns in foreclosure and summarize the evidence for foreclosure spillovers in urban neighborhoods. Finally, we offer some thoughts on future innovations in mortgage finance.},

A crucial issue is the bias between the peptide MS intensity and the actual peptide abundance, i.e., the fact that peptides with equal abundance may have different MS intensities. This bias is mainly caused by the diverse physicochemical properties of peptides. Here, we propose a novel algorithm for label-free absolute protein quantification, LFAQ, which can correct the biased MS intensities by using the predicted peptide quantitative factors for all identified peptides. When validated on datasets produced by different MS instruments and data acquisition modes, LFAQ presented accuracy and precision superior to those of existing methods. In particular, it reduced the quantification error by an average of 46\% for low-abundance proteins.},

  abstract = {Starting with Malthus, several commentators have identified some quantitative elements in the work of Plato that led them to consider him a precursor of demographic thought. This article shows that this interpretation runs against the existence of contradictions between the text of Laws and Republic, and that a demographic point of view is not consistent with the profound coherence of Plato's thought. A fascination for mathematics and the Pythagorean influence are part of the explanation. But above all, it is the concept of the City, at the same time an ideal utopian model and a concrete social construct, that provides the key to Plato's "demographic" thought. Faced with the fundamental problem of power and justice, Plato proposes as a solution the restoration of harmony between the City as a political entity and the citizens who compose it. This philosophical approach is complemented by polemical hostility towards the democracy that was, according to him, responsible for the decadence of Athens. Philosophy and the political history of Greece in the fifth and fourth century B. C. are thus essential to an understanding of the meaning of measures that are wrongly qualified as demographic and eugenic and suspected of arising from a totalitarian vision when, in truth, they refer to a concept of man that is quite different from ours.},

  abstract = {Are the well-known facts about urbanization in the United States also true for the developing world? We compare American metropolitan areas with analogous geographic units in Brazil, China and India. Both Gibrat's Law and Zipf's Law seem to hold as well in Brazil as in the U.S., but China and India look quite different. In Brazil and China, the implications of the spatial equilibrium hypothesis, the central organizing idea of urban economics, are not rejected. The India data, however, repeatedly rejects tests inspired by the spatial equilibrium assumption. One hypothesis is that spatial equilibrium only emerges with economic development, as markets replace social relationships and as human capital spreads more widely. In all four countries there is strong evidence of agglomeration economies and human capital externalities. The correlation between density and earnings is stronger in both China and India than in the U.S., strongest in China. In India the gap between urban and rural wages is huge, but the correlation between city size and earnings is more modest. The cross-sectional relationship between area-level skills and both earnings and area-level growth are also stronger in the developing world than in the U.S. The forces that drive urban success seem similar in the rich and poor world, even if limited migration and difficult housing markets make it harder for a spatial equilibrium to develop.},

  abstract = {Spatial correlation modeling comprises both spatial autocorrelation and spatial cross-correlation processes. The spatial autocorrelation theory has been well-developed. It is necessary to advance the method of spatial cross-correlation analysis to supplement the autocorrelation analysis. This paper presents a set of models and analytical procedures for spatial cross-correlation analysis. By analogy with Moran's index newly expressed in a spatial quadratic form, a theoretical framework is derived for geographical cross-correlation modeling. First, two sets of spatial cross-correlation coefficients are defined, including a global spatial cross-correlation coefficient and local spatial cross-correlation coefficients. Second, a pair of scatterplots of spatial cross-correlation is proposed, and the plots can be used to visually reveal the causality behind spatial systems. Based on the global cross-correlation coefficient, Pearson's correlation coefficient can be decomposed into two parts: direct correlation (partial correlation) and indirect correlation (spatial cross-correlation). As an example, the methodology is applied to the relationships between China's urbanization and economic development to illustrate how to model spatial cross-correlation phenomena. This study is an introduction to developing the theory of spatial cross-correlation, and future geographical spatial analysis might benefit from these models and indexes.},

We argue that big data should be perceived as a continuous, unstructured and unprocessed dynamics of primitives, rather than as points (snapshots) or summaries (aggregates) of an underlying phenomenon. Given this, we show that big data can be generated through agent-based models but not by equation-based models. Though statistical and machine learning tools can be used to analyse big data, they do not constitute a big data-generation mechanism. Furthermore, agent-based models can aid in evaluating the quality (interpreted as information aggregation efficiency) of big data. Based on this, we argue that agent-based modelling can serve as a possible foundation for big data. We substantiate this interpretation through some pioneering studies from the 1980s on swarm intelligence and several prototypical agent-based models developed around the 2000s.},

  abstract = {This paper measures job accessibility within Accra and assesses its relationship with labour outcomes. We provide consistent estimates of each neighbourhood's accessibility to employment opportunities using innovative datasets. We concentrate on the three main commuting modes (private cars, walking, and informal shared mini-buses) and identify sharp disparities with respect to job accessibility by commuting mode. While most jobs can be reached by car within 60 minutes from any neighbourhood, only between 20 to 30\% of formal jobs on average are accessible in the same timeframe by the more popular minibus. We complement these findings by looking at how accessibility is related to individual labour outcomes. Our findings suggest that a better access to employment opportunities is correlated with a higher likelihood of employment and a lower probability of engaging in the informal sector. Women tend to be the most affected. Supporting these findings, we also see firms located in neighbourhoods with a greater labour pool reach being less likely to report unfilled vacancies. On the whole, while descriptive, the analysis strongly suggests that Accra's lack of efficient connectivity harms labour and firm economic outcomes.},

As our urban challenges grow more complex, learning how to do this effectively becomes ever more important. For educators, this means teaching students how to work in interdisciplinary settings, i.e. how to jointly discover the different disciplinary dimensions of an urban problem, and how to reflectively design courses of action. In this paper, we explore and evaluate the components of such interdisciplinary experiential learning, develop a framework to design and analyse this type of courses, and use it to position and evaluate a specific urban development management course. Results show that, by performing and reflecting upon specific professional roles, the course stimulates students to both integrate different disciplines and reflect on an array of academic and practical insights. Based on our evaluation, we discuss several didactical aspects that may help lecturers to improve their interdisciplinary teaching in urban planning, design, and management courses{\textemdash}particularly when creating learning experiences in an increasingly diverse professional, societal and educational setting.},

Well over half of the global workforce and the vast majority of the workforce in developing countries work in the informal economy, and in countries around the world new forms of informal employment are emerging. Yet the informal workforce is not well understood, remains undervalued and is widely stigmatized. Divided into three sets of chapters, this book focuses on specific groups of informal workers - homeworkers, street vendors and waste pickers-to provide a grounded reality to the disciplinary debates. It calls for a paradigm shift in how the informal economy is perceived to reflect the realities of informal work in the global South as well as the informal practices of the State and Capital, not just Labour. Contributors to the volume bridge a range of disciplinary perspectives including anthropology, development economics, law, political science, social policy, sociology, statistics, urban planning and design. The Informal Economy Revisited is the culmination of twenty years of pioneering work by WIEGO (Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing), a global network of researchers, development practitioners and organizations of informal workers in 90 countries. Researchers, practitioners, policy makers and advocates will all find this book an invaluable guide to the significance and complexities of the informal economy, and its role in today's globalized economy"--},

  abstract = {The rank{\textendash}size distribution of cities follows Zipf's law, and the Zipf scaling exponent often tends to a constant 1. This seems to be a general rule. However, a recent numerical experiment shows that there exists a contradiction between the Zipf exponent 1 and high urbanization level in a large population country. In this paper, mathematical modeling, computational analysis, and the method of proof by contradiction are employed to reveal the numerical relationships between urbanization level and Zipf scaling exponent. The main findings are as follows. (1) If Zipf scaling exponent equals 1, the urbanization rate of a large populous country can hardly exceed 50\%. (2) If Zipf scaling exponent is less than 1, the urbanization level of large populous countries can exceeds 80\%. A conclusion can be drawn that the Zipf exponent is the control parameter for the urbanization dynamics. In order to improve the urbanization level of large population countries, it is necessary to reduce the Zipf scaling exponent. Allometric growth law is employed to interpret the change of Zipf exponent, and scaling transform is employed to prove that different definitions of cities do no influence the above analytical conclusion essentially. This study provides a new way of looking at Zipf's law of city-size distribution and urbanization dynamics.},

  abstract = {In this paper, I suggest that the history of the classification system used by the American Economic Association (AEA) to list economic literature and scholars is a relevant proxy to understand the transformation of economics science throughout the twentieth century. Successive classifications were fashioned through heated discussions on the status of theoretical and empirical work, data and measurement, and proper objects of analysis. They also reflected the contradictory demands of users, including economists but also civil servants, journalists, publishers, librarians, and the military, and reflected rapidly changing institutional and technological constraints. Until the late 1940s, disagreements on the general structure of the classification dominated AEA discussions. As the subject matters, methods, and definition of economics rapidly evolved after the war, methodological debates raged on the status of theoretical and empirical work and the degree of unification of the discipline. It was therefore the ordering and content of major categories that was closely discussed during the 1956 revision. The 1966 revision, in contrast, was fueled by institutional and technical transformations rather than intellectual ones. Classifiers essentially reacted to changes in the way economists' work was evaluated, the nature and size of the literature they produced, the publishing industry, and the use of computer facilities. The final 1988-90 revision was an attempt by the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) editors to translate the mature core fields structure of their science into a set of codes and accommodate the new types of applied work economists identified themselves with. The 1990 classification system was only incrementally transformed in the next twenty years, but that the AEA is currently considering a new revision may signal more profound changes in the structure of economics.},

I then compare these accounts with the few instances where 20th century economists have discussed tractability openly, and I show that such a short survey suggests that historians could contribute by documenting the collective dynamics at work when tractability motives are invoked. I suggest that disentangling theoretical, empirical and computational tractability might be fruitful, but also difficult. I ask how and why choices made for tractability purpose meant to be idiosyncratic and temporary often become collectively entrenched, sometimes creating ``tractability traps.'' Finally, I consider the existence of ``tractability standards'' that differ across time and fields.},

We present a model of demonetization where agents hold cash both to satisfy a cash-in-advance constraint and for tax evasion purposes. We test the predictions of the model in the cross-section of Indian districts using several novel data sets including: the geographic distribution of demonetized and new notes for causal inference; night light activity and employment surveys to measure economic activity including in the informal sector; debit/credit cards and e-wallet transactions data; and banking data on deposit and credit growth. Districts experiencing more severe demonetization had relative reductions in economic activity, faster adoption of alternative payment technologies, and lower bank credit growth. The cross-sectional responses cumulate to a contraction in aggregate employment and night lights-based output due to the the cash shortage of at least 2 percentage points and of bank credit of 2 percentage points in 2016Q4 relative to their counterfactual paths, effects that dissipate over the next few months. Our analysis rejects monetary neutrality using a large-scale natural experiment, something that is still rare in the vast literature on the effects of monetary policy.},

This paper makes the case for understanding this development challenge at the nexus of urban governance and city infrastructure. Tracing African urban development trends over the post-colonial period, the paper makes three arguments. First, African cities experience fractured fiscal authority. Decentralization reforms have resulted in contested and complex city governance arrangements. Second, large scale infrastructure investments have been the focus of donors and investors. This has resulted in fragmented networks and systems. Finally, these two processes together have created fertile ground for the emergence hybrid systems of service delivery in cities. This has implications for both how urban services are governed and their material arrangements. This reality, and the underlying processes which contributed to its production, are under-accounted for within global development discourses. In conclusion, it is crucial that new models of infrastructure finance are developed to respond to the fractured fiscal authority, fragmented infrastructure networks, and hybrid service delivery patterns which characterise African cities.},

  abstract = {Before the Industrial Revolution in Britain most workers controlled their pace, timing, and conduct at work. Factory discipline radically changed this. Employers now dictated how, when, and in what manner work was done. Why did discipline triumph? Was it required by the need to tightly coordinate workers with new technologies? Or was it successful because it coerced more effort from workers than they would freely give? The empirical evidence shows that discipline succeeded mainly by increasing work effort. Workers effectively hired capitalists to make them work harder. They lacked the self-control to achieve higher earnings on their own. One reason that the Industrial Revolution was greeted with hostility by many was its association with a revolutionary change in the way work life was organized. Two changes occurred. In the first employers collected workers into workshops or "manufactories" that they owned. Although this caused some complaint, the alteration in working conditions was seemingly minor. Workers in these workshops controlled their own hours, work pace, and conduct. They took breaks when they wanted and socialized at work as they wished. Moreover, they were not paid any more than equivalent domestic workers per unit of output, implying that they did not find the conditions of the workshop unpleasant. The second and later change was the imposition on these concentrated workers of "factory discipline." With factory discipline the employer dictated when workers worked, their conduct on the job, and that they steadily attend to their assigned tasks. Under discipline workers were rewarded not only according to their output, as in the workshop, but also-or even exclusively-based on their behavior in the workplace. Workers were heavily penalized for small deviations from the approved rules of conduct. They seem to have strongly resented factory discipline, and evidence from the market is that they were paid a substantial premium to work under such conditions.1},

  abstract = {The life-course approach to residential mobility and migration recognizes a central role for a variety of demographic and economic triggers in the mobility process. Having a child, getting married, separated, or divorced, have all been identified as triggers that generate residential relocations. It is obvious that a job change can also be viewed as a stimulus for residential relocation, although until now the interconnection has been evaluated mainly for long-distance migratory moves rather than for its effects on residential mobility. In this analysis we use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to test the association between employment changes and residential relocation. We examine both the occurrence and the timing of residential moves triggered by employment transitions. We show that job changes increase the likelihood of residential relocation in the aggregate and for singles when we hold other 'triggers' constant. The results of the analysis of the timing of job changes and residential relocations indicate that temporal differences exist between households types. Overall, the results establish that job change is an important triggering process in residential relocation and emphasizes the interconnected nature of life-course events.},

Do households minimize commuting distances when they change residences and what are the differences for one-worker and two-worker households? The analysis utilizes descriptive measures of distance and time to work for pre-and post-residential relocations and develops estimates from a probability model of workplace attraction. We extend earlier research on commuting distances by using a multinodal rather than a monocentric city, by specifically considering the commuting responses of two-worker households and by formally estimating a model of the response to commuting distances. The findings indicate that both one-and two-worker households with greater separation between workplace and residence make decreases in distance and time. Overall, as other studies have shown, women commute shorter distances and are more likely to minimize commuting after a move than are men. The probability model fits the likelihood of decreasing distance with greater separation and provides a more exact specification of the connection between residence and workplace than previous analyses of this relationship.},

Measuring education status through Oxbridge attendance suggests a generalized intergenerational correlation in status in the range of 0.70{\textendash}0.90. Social status is more strongly inherited even than height. This correlation is unchanged over centuries. Social mobility in England in 2012 was little greater than in preindustrial times.

  abstract = {Mainstreaming nature-based solutions in cities has grown in scale and magnitude in recent times but is still considered to be the main challenge for transitioning our cities and their communities to be more climate resilient and liveable: environmentally, economically, and socially. Furthermore, taking nature-based solutions to the next level, and scaling them out to all urban contexts to achieve a greater impact, is proving to be slow and often conflicts with other transitioning initiatives such as energy generation, mobility and transport initiatives, and infilling to combat sprawl. So, the task is neither easy nor straightforward; there are many barriers to this novel transition, especially when it comes to collaborative approaches to implementing nature-based solutions with diverse urban communities and within city authorities themselves. This paper reports on a new process that is systematically co-produced and captured as a framework for planning nature-based solutions that emerged during the Connecting Nature project. The Connecting Nature Framework is a three-stage, iterative process that involves seven key activity areas for mainstreaming nature-based solutions: technical solutions, governance, financing and business models, nature-based enterprises, co-production, reflexive monitoring, and impact assessment. The tested and applied framework is designed to address and overcome barriers to the imple\- mentation of nature-based solutions in cities via a co-created, iterative, and reflective approach. The planning process guided by the proposed framework has already yielded promising results with some of the cities of the project, though further usage and its adoption by other cities is needed to explore its potential in different contexts especially in the Global South. The paper concludes with suggestions on how this may be realised.},

The most important concerns are about endogeneity at the local and individual levels, the choice of a productivity measure between wages and total-factor productivity, and the roles of spatial scale, firms' characteristics, and functional forms. Estimated impacts of local determinants of productivity, employment, and firms' location choices are surveyed for both developed and developing economies. We finally provide a discussion of attempts to identify and quantify specific agglomeration mechanisms.},

Situating our research within urban policy mobilities literature, we investigate the `Africa rising' narrative and representation of Africa as a `last development frontier' and `last piece of cake', an imaginary that provides fertile ground for the construction of new cities. Building upon research on the practices of `seduction' that facilitate urban policy circulation, we argue for the relevance of critically examining elite stakeholder rhetoric to understand the relative ease with which the new city development model is being promoted in Africa. We investigate the enablers, advocates and boosters of new cities, represented mainly by states, corporations, non-profits and consultants to render visible the complex networks of relations and private interests that support and enable the creation and circulation of the new cities model in Africa. We also analyse the pervasive `right to development' argument among African elites, which precludes criticism of new city ventures and circulates problematic assumptions about modernity and development. We conclude by discussing how stakeholder rhetoric limits the range of urban visions that are put into circulation and mobilized for Africa's urban future.},

However, little evidence exists as to the factors which influence the level of urban unevenness, as expressed by the slope of the rank-size distribution, partly because the diversity of results found in the literature follows the heterogeneity of analysis specifications. In this study, I set up a meta-analysis of Zipf's law which accounts for technical as well as topical factors of variations of Zipf's coefficient. I found 86 studies publishing at least one empirical estimation of this coefficient and recorded their metadata into an open database. I regressed the 1962 corresponding estimates with variables describing the study and the estimation process as well as socio-demographic variables describing the territory under enquiry. A dynamic meta-analysis was also performed to look for factors of evolution of city size unevenness. The results of the most interesting models are presented in the article, whereas all analyses can be reproduced on a dedicated online platform. The results show that on average, 40\% of the variation of Zipf's coefficients is due to the technical choices. The main other variables associated with distinct evolutions are linked to the urbanisation process rather than the process of economic development and population growth. Finally, no evidence was found to support the effectiveness of past planning actions in modifying this urban feature.},

  abstract = {Scaling laws are powerful summaries of the variations of urban attributes with city size. However, the validity of their universal meaning for cities is hampered by the observation that different scaling regimes can be encountered for the same territory, time and attribute, depending on the criteria used to delineate cities. The aim of this paper is to present new insights concerning this variation, coupled with a sensitivity analysis of urban scaling in France, for several socio-economic and infrastructural attributes from data collected exhaustively at the local level. The sensitivity analysis considers different aggregations of local units for which data are given by the Population Census. We produce a large variety of definitions of cities (approximatively 5000) by aggregating local Census units corresponding to the systematic combination of three definitional criteria: density, commuting flows and population cutoffs. We then measure the magnitude of scaling estimations and their sensitivity to city definitions for several urban indicators, showing for example that simple population cutoffs impact dramatically on the results obtained for a given system and attribute. Variations are interpreted with respect to the meaning of the attributes (socio-economic descriptors as well as infrastructure) and the urban definitions used (understood as the combination of the three criteria). Because of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) and of the heterogeneous morphologies and social landscapes in the cities' internal space, scaling estimations are subject to large variations, distorting many of the conclusions on which generative models are based. We conclude that examining scaling variations might be an opportunity to understand better the inner composition of cities with regard to their size, i.e. to link the scales of the city-system with the system of cities.},

Beyond the high-profile global platforms, the technology is contributing to changing patterns of work. Yet the existing framework of employment legislation and public policy more broadly {\textendash} from minimum wages to benefits and pensions {\textendash} is structured around the concept of `the firm' as the agent of policy delivery. To reshape policies in order to protect the interests of people as workers as well as consumers, it is important to understand why digital innovators make the choices they do, and therefore how labour market policies can improve working conditions without constraining the productivity and consumer benefits enabled by digital business models.},

This study shows that deindustrialization has not produced a large class of black lowwage service-sector workers. Instead, it has produced a professionalizing occupational structure alongside high unemployment. Although whites benefited from the growth of the professional and managerial jobs, these occupations have been substantially deracialized. The consequence for the racial geography of Cape Town is that the city is becoming divided into racially mixed middle-class neighborhoods and black working-class neighborhoods characterized by high unemployment.},

Urban expansion is correlated with some socio-territorial factors and the impacts are assessed for the loss of biomass. In both periods, the urban zone differed the most from the other two in terms of urban expansion. The Geomod predictions overestimate the urban expansion in the urban zone and underestimate it in the peri-urban and rural zones. Significant differences exist in the average urban expansion between zones. The main urban growth drivers were elevation, population density, distance to previous urban land and distance to roads. A substantial loss of biomass is due to urban growth, including expansion and infill. The research reveals significant differences in growth between peri-urban, rural and urban areas, and contributes spatial information for designing focused land-use policies in dynamic urban contexts.},

  abstract = {Green space (GS) plays a crucial role in reducing the urban heat island (UHI) effect and helps in mitigating climate change. In Indian cities, GS are highly vulnerable due to rapid urbanization and infrastructural devel\- opment. This study aims to assess the cooling effect of urban parks such as GS on the thermal environment in Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA), India. Five urban parks were selected from different parts of KMA for the assessment during the summer season. Three greenness indices (normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index and soil adjusted vegetation index) and two thermal indices (land surface tempera\- ture and temperature condition index) were used to find out the cooling effect on the thermal environment. Relative land surface temperature (RLST) and vegetation cooling index (VCI) was developed for a better un\- derstanding of the relationship between greenness on the thermal environment. Correlation and regression analysis was also performed to show the relationship as well the effect of greenness parameters on thermal conditions. From the result, it was found that urban parks had a substantial impact on the cooling effect. (i) Botanical Park was the coldest park with an average LST of 33.55{$^0$}C, followed by Nicco park (34.33{$^0$}C), Nature park (34.48{$^0$}C), Rabindra Sarabor (34.55{$^0$}C), and Central Park (36.65{$^0$}C) (ii) RLST had a negative correlation with PV (R = -0.51 for Botanical Park; R= -0.65 for Nature park; R= -0.57 for Central park) and (iii) finally, greenness had a negative impact on the thermal pattern in KMA (R = -0.16). Thus, from the results, it was documented that urban parks (as GS) had cooling effect on the surrounding areas. Therefore, the conservation of GS is essential to achieving sustainable development goals (particularly goals- 3, 11, 13, and 15).},

Our emphasis is on calibrated models that can be compared with data. In each section, we discuss the important questions, the typical set of tools used, and the insights that result from influential articles. Although great progress has been made in understanding the impact of housing outcomes on macroeconomic aggregates and vice versa, work remains. For example, economists recognize the importance of changing credit-market conditions in amplifying the volatility of house prices, but cannot explain the timing of these changes. At the end of the chapter, we discuss a new literature that assesses the macroeconomic effects and welfare implications of housing policies.},

  abstract = {This paper offers a reflection on 15 years of policy change in the City of Cape Town aimed at fostering sustainability from the perspective of a City practitioner. The persistent continuation of unsustainable outcomes, despite ongoing policy reforms, is understood as a combination of the emergence of wicked problems, within a changing local government mandate, in the absence of a transformation of institutional structures, tools and approaches. While the approach to policy reform in Cape Town has focussed on reducing substantive uncertainty through its knowledge-based approach, we show that in the context of an expanding local government mandate, sustainability becomes an aspect of many departments' directive resulting in strategic uncertainty. The untransformed traditional line-function-based structure of local government in turn works against integration between departments (fundamental for addressing non-linear wicked problems), thus promoting institutional uncertainty. In addressing this combination of strategic and institutional uncertainty, our findings indicate that integration has to happen in the policy stage in order for sustainability principles to be implemented in relevant departments; that implementation requires resourcing across the institution, and ought to be included in departments' targets; and that competing and conflicting rationalities underpin the policy{\textendash}practice gap. It is suggested that a first step in breaking down the strategic and institutional uncertainties would be to foster shared values through creating deliberative spaces within the City in which debate, discussion and learning can occur.},

With the upsurge of evidence-based planning, much is rehearsed about the utilitarian necessity of making such connection. What is less widely discussed is the epistemological nuances and challenges of knowledge{\textendash}action relationship. This essay aims to contribute to the latter by conceptualising planning as practice of knowing. This is to shift the focus from knowledge as something that planners have to knowing as something that planners do. I would argue that, rather than thinking about knowledge as having an instrumental place in planning, it is more useful to think about planning as practice of knowing that involves knowing what, knowing how, knowing to what end and doing. Seen in this way, practice of knowing is a dynamic process that is situated and provisional, collective and distributed, purposive and pragmatic, and mediated and contested.},

Within urban areas, extensions to our approach allow us to distinguish `core' urban pixels and detect centres and subcentres. Finally, we develop novel one- and two-sided tests that provide a statistical basis to compare maps with different delineations, which we use to assess the robustness of our approach and to document large differences between our preferred delineation and the corresponding official one.},

The remote sensing and GIS are considered as an effective monitoring and decision-support tool in urban planning. This study compiles the results of a study undertaken to measure the urban sprawl in Dehradun city, India through cellular automata CA-Markov model. CA-Markov model can effectively be used to study the urban dynamics in rapidly growing cities. Being an effective tool for encoding spatial structures, the information generated by it could be used to predict urban scenarios for sustainable growth. To achieve the goal, the temporal images of LISS IV were used to analyse the spatial pattern of land cover change in the area and the future growth was modeled by applying CA-Markov model. The results clearly suggest that major changes between the periods of 2004 and 2009 occurred in built up classes (about 27\%) followed by agriculture (17.7\%) and fallow land (10.2\%). The projection as predicted using CA-Markov model suggested a value of kappa coefficient = 0.91 which indicates the validity of the model to predict future projections. Modeling suggested a clear trend of various land use classes' transformation in the area of urban built up expansions. It is concluded that RS and GIS can be an effective decision support tool for policy makers to design sustainable urban habitats.},

  abstract = {The Latin American region has been marked by a historic process of extractivism and weak institutional struc\- tures, causing deep socio-environmental and economic crises. The resaturation of territorial justice has then become the center of the debate. Nature-based solutions, for their innovative and systemic nature, could be key in approaching these complex problems. However, the interplay between these strategies and justice is not clear enough. This article addresses this interaction centering on protected areas, the most traditional response from regional governments to nature degradation. We attempt to test the hypothesis that integrating protected areas in land use planning policies improves the exercise of justice, understanding it from a place-based point of view. To this end, we carried out quali- and quantitative analysis of social perceptions, historical background, land use policies and governance in Tandil and Tornquist, two municipal districts of the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The results showed that i) protected areas were associated with justice if a conservation project reached a legal rule and if the community was involved in its formulation and management; ii) the integration of protected areas in land use planning policies helped to satisfy both conditions. We end by proposing a theoretical model which outlines how three strengths of land use planning can turn PAs into more just NbS. We also discuss the need to develop a broader and place-based approach of justice as ``territorial justice''.},

  abstract = {The Death and Life of Great American Cities was written in 1961 and is now one of the most influential book in city planning. In it, Jane Jacobs proposed four conditions that promote life in a city. However, these conditions have not been empirically tested until recently. This is mainly because it is hard to collect data about "city life". The city of Seoul recently collected pedestrian activity through surveys at an unprecedented scale, with an effort spanning more than a decade, allowing researchers to conduct the first study successfully testing Jacobs's conditions. In this paper, we identify a valuable alternative to the lengthy and costly collection of activity survey data: mobile phone data. We extract human activity from such data, collect land use and socio-demographic information from the Italian Census and Open Street Map, and test the four conditions in six Italian cities. Although these cities are very different from the places for which Jacobs's conditions were spelled out (i.e., great American cities) and from the places in which they were recently tested (i.e., the Asian city of Seoul), we find those conditions to be indeed associated with urban life in Italy as well. Our methodology promises to have a great impact on urban studies, not least because, if replicated, it will make it possible to test Jacobs's theories at scale.},

The empirical study of scaling on a wide range of urban datasets displays apparent nonlinear behaviors whose statistical validity and meaning were recently the focus of many debates. We discuss here another aspect, which is the implication of such scaling forms on individual cities and how they can be used for predicting the behavior of a city when its population changes. We illustrate this discussion in the case of delay due to traffic congestion with a dataset of 101 US cities in the years 1982{\textendash}2014. We show that the scaling form obtained by agglomerating all of the available data for different cities and for different years does display a nonlinear behavior, but which appears to be unrelated to the dynamics of individual cities when their population grows. In other words, the congestion-induced delay in a given city does not depend on its population only, but also on its previous history. This strong path dependency prohibits the existence of a simple scaling form valid for all cities and shows that we cannot always agglomerate the data for many different systems. More generally, these results also challenge the use of transversal data for understanding longitudinal series for cities.},

Climatic risks, economic fluctuations, and a large number of individual-specific shocks leave these households vulnerable to severe hardship. The paper explores the links between risk, vulnerability and poverty, taking a micro-level perspective. Risk does not just result in variability in living standards. There is increasing evidence that the lack of means to cope with risk and vulnerability is in itself a cause of persistent poverty and poverty traps. Risk results in strategies that avoid taking advantage of profitable but risky opportunities. Shocks destroy human, physical and social capital limiting opportunities further.},

Borrowing from Chakrabarty's concept of History 1 and History 2, I name these approaches `Urbanization 1' and `Urbanization 2'. Urbanization 1 is exemplified by the planetary urbanization thesis that posits the complete urbanization of society, whereas Urbanization 2 is characterized by a more diverse set of interventions, united by a political and epistemological strategy of refusing Eurocentrism and `provincializing' urban theory.},

Moving beyond the coarse rural-urban distinction, we then focus on the continuum of locations in an economy and describe how the patterns of convergence and divergence change with development. As we discuss, these spatial dynamics often mask important differences across sectors. We then turn our attention to the right tail of the distribution, the urban sector. We analyze how the urban hierarchy has changed over time in developed countries and more recently in developing countries. The chapter reviews both the empirical evidence and the theoretical models that can account for what we observe in the data. When discussing the stylized facts on geography and development, we draw on empirical evidence from both the historical evolution of today's developed economies and comparisons between today's developed and developing economies.},

But throughout U.S. history, local population growth has significantly deviated from it. Across small locations, growth was strongly negatively correlated with initial population throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This strong convergence gave way to moderate divergence beginning in the mid-twentieth century. Across intermediate and large locations, growth became moderately positively correlated with initial population starting in the late nineteenth century. This divergence eventually dissipated but never completely. A simple-one sector model combining the entry of new locations, a friction from population growth, and a decrease in the congestion arising from the supply of land closely matches these and a number of other evolving empirical relationships.},

  abstract = {"Key global players increasingly politicize discussion of climatic change. This is especially evident in regard to Bangladesh, much of which is perilously close to sea level and vulnerable to flooding, and which has long been the recipient of various development schemes for "poverty reduction" or "progress" to justify interventions in its environment and society. Some of these projects have resulted in severe, often unintended, environmental effects, such as silting of waterbodies that are surrounded by embankments; biodiversity loss and weakening of the sea walls (which protect against floods) resulting from tiger-prawn monoculture; and loss of soil fertility in intensive agriculture. Camelia Dewan utilizes ethnography and environmental history to highlight flawed assumptions of international development projects in Bangladesh, which often misread the coastal landscape by attributing causality solely to climate change. Examination of multiple and often conflicting perspectives-from poor rural coastal populations, middle-class elites, political actors, and NGO staff-shows how, since the colonial era, Bangladesh has endured intrusions, and how its current environmental crisis goes beyond global warming. This case study informs broader issues worldwide by documenting how the idea of climate change shapes development projects in the Global South, and the extent to which these endeavors correspond with the problems and concerns of populations they are intended to help. This provocative study will be welcomed by readers in the fields of environmental anthropology, human geography, and development studies"--},

Does economic growth follow the extension of HSR as a result of improved accessibility? This study investigates the impact of HSR on the economic geography of China. We find that HSR has improved the accessibility (as measured by weighted average travel time) of Chinese cities by 12.11\% at the national level from 2009 to 2013. However, the accessibility benefit of HSR is not distributed evenly over space. Cities in the wealthy eastern region and with HSR access enjoy higher accessibility benefit compared with cities in the hinterland and without direct HSR access. Using a difference-in-differences analysis and an instrumental variable strategy to address the non-random placement of HSR stations, we also find that on average, HSR cities have experienced a significant increase in fixed asset investment after the inauguration of HSR service, which could stimulate future economic growth. The treatment effect of HSR on investment varies with city size. Second-tier cities with relatively large population bases benefit more from HSR in attracting investment compared with small cities and mega cities, which could experience marginal or negative investment growth.},

  abstract = {Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) have been advocated for their potential to contribute to the making of sustainable and just cities. However, a growing body of research shows that NBS cannot inherently provide just outcomes and might instead (re)produce environmental injustices. This research explores NBS for stream/river restoration in `informal' areas, showing how riparian margins have become spaces of conflict. It draws lessons from two linear parks integrated into neighbourhood regeneration strategies in Sa{\texttildelow}o Paulo. Data were collected from household surveys and focus group discussions to examine local populations' values towards stream restoration. They provide understandings of residents' perceptions towards multiple health and safety risks and concerns over contested responsibilities, notably revealing that local preferences for stream burial have been shaped by persisting waste dumping issues. An environmental justice lens helps highlight the limited integration of plural social and cultural values into project plans. This further helps draw lessons on ways to address local conflicts and integrate multiple socio-environmental values into NBS planning, with support from policy tools that allow stronger community engagement. Findings also support the identification of justice pathways for NBS in informal settings. The analysis of material and interpretative human-environment relationships provides evidence of opportunities for NBS to be integrated into everyday uses of local space and pre-existing environmental caring practices. For this, communities need to have stronger influence over decisions affecting them. The research thereby demonstrates that NBS will only become a mechanism for ecological recovery with city-wide benefits if marginalised groups are better included in their planning.},

  abstract = {Imperatives to develop more walkable, transit-oriented and low-carbon cities have accentuated the need to understand the performance and possible transformation of urban access networks. Within a framework of complex adaptive systems and assemblage thinking we develop isochrone mapping of urban transport access in four transport modes: walking, cycling, public transport and cars. These isochrones can be used to compare the range and area of urban access for each of these modes, over different time limits and for different times of day. Such mapping gears urban morphology to the phenomenology of urban transport and enables us to better understand mode choice. Through design research we can also test a range of possible design scenarios for infrastructure investment and show their impact on the isochrone maps. We conclude with a focus on the relations between car and public transport isochrones as a means of better understanding car-dependency and what we call the `Car/PT assemblage'.},

This is due to the ontological and epistemological idiosyncrasies of research in supply chain management, which need to be accounted for when retrieving, selecting, and synthesizing studies in an SLR. Therefore, we propose a new paradigm for SLRs in the supply chain domain that is based on both best practice and the unique attributes of doing supply chain management research. This approach involves exploring existing studies with attention to theoretical boundaries, units of analysis, sources of data, study contexts, and definitions and the operationalization of constructs, as well as research methods, with the goal of refining or revising existing theory. This new paradigm will push supply chain management research to the frontier of current methodological standards and build a foundation for improving the contribution of future SLRs in the supply chain and adjacent management disciplines.},

To these questions, the urban growth literature has offered a variety of answers. Within an integrated framework, this chapter reviews key theories with implications for urban growth. It then relates these theories to empirical evidence on the main drivers of city growth, drawn primarily from the United States and other developed countries. Consistent with the monocentric city model, fewer roads and restrictions on housing supply hinder urban growth. The fact that housing is durable also has important effects on the evolution of cities. In recent decades, cities with better amenities have grown faster. Agglomeration economies and human capital are also important drivers of city growth. Although more human capital, smaller firms, and a greater diversity in production foster urban growth, the exact channels through which those effects percolate are not clearly identified. Finally, shocks also determine the fate of cities. Structural changes affecting the broader economy have left a big footprint on the urban landscape. Small city-specific shocks also appear to matter, consistent with the recent wave of random growth models. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

This emphasis reflects Krugman's view that formal modeling holds the most promise for understanding spatial aspects of urbanization. Krugman's interventions into economic geography have in turn allowed him to develop and articulate his own view of the future of social science: that is, the explanation of self-organizing behaviour should be the focal point of research, and formal modelling is the key means of advancing this agenda.

  abstract = {This chapter reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on agglomeration economies and urban public infrastructure. Theory links the two concepts by positing that agglomeration economies exist when firms in an urban area share a public good as an input to production. One type of shareable input is the close proximity of businesses and labor, that generates positive externalities which in turn lower the production cost of one business as the output of other businesses increases. The externalities result from businesses sharing nonexcludable inputs, such as a common labor pool, technical expertise, general knowledge and personal contacts. Another perhaps more tangible type of shareable input is urban public infrastructure. Public capital stock, such as highways, water treatment facilities, and communication systems, directly affect the efficient operation of cities by facilitating business activities and improving worker productivity. The literature has devoted considerable attention to both topics, but not together. Studies of agglomeration economies in several countries find that manufacturing firms are more productive in large cities than in smaller ones. Studies of the effect of infrastructure on productivity show positive, but in some cases statistically insignificant, effects of public capital stock on productivity. Most of these studies are at the national and state levels. Only a handful of studies have focused on the metropolitan level, and even fewer have estimated agglomeration economies and infrastructure effects simultaneously. Results from studies that include both types of shared inputs suggest that both spatial proximity and physical infrastructure contribute positively to the productivity of firms in urban areas. More research is needed to explore the interrelationships between urban size and urban public infrastructure and to open the "black box" of agglomeration economies and estimate how the various other factors associated with urban size affect productivity. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {This study gives a synthesis of a model comparison assessing the technological feasibility and economic consequences of achieving greenhouse gas concentration targets that are sufficiently low to keep the increase in global mean temperature below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. All five global energy-environment-economy models show that achieving low greenhouse gas concentration targets is technically feasible and economically viable. The ranking of the importance of individual technology options is robust across models. For the lowest stabilization target (400 ppm CO2 eq), the use of bio-energy in combination with CCS plays a crucial role, and biomass potential dominates the cost of reaching this target. Without CCS or the considerable extension of renewables the 400 ppm CO2 eq target is not achievable. Across the models, estimated aggregate costs up to 2100 are below 0.8\% global GDP for 550 ppm CO2 eq stabilization and below 2.5\% for the 400 ppm CO2 eq pathway.

We analyze decentralized matching into these groups, and the equilibrium composition of participants that consequently arises. We find that participants sort remarkably well across the competing groups, and that they re-sort immediately following an unexpected exogenous regulatory change. These findings suggest that the competitive matching model might have applicability and bite in other settings where matching is an important equilibrium phenomenon. (JEL: O12, O17, G20, D40)},

  abstract = {Urban sprawl is a complex phenomenon that requires a comprehensive reflection on the most significant patterns and underlying processes. While the "sprawl" notion parallels hegemonic concepts such as economic competitiveness, social cohesion, and polycentric development, an integrated analysis of sprawl patterns and processes in paradigmatic socioeconomic contexts is increasingly required to reconcile dierent disciplinary visions, contributing to a holistic interpretation of metropolitan change. At the same time, sprawl is an increasingly evident product of local socioeconomic contexts all over the world. A comprehensive investigation of multifaceted, form-function relationships underlying sprawl-based on a quali-quantitative analysis of representative cases-is a crucial pre-requisite of both monitoring and policy actions at multiple spatial scales, from urban/regional to national/continental levels. The present contribution proposes a contextualization of the sprawl notion in Southern Europe-a socioeconomic context characterized by compact and continuous urbanization for a long time. An integrated approach based on a visual analysis of urban and peri-urban landscapes-integrated with an extended literature survey-allows for a definition of a specific sprawl model in Southern Europe, sharing some features with the United States ideal type of sprawl and showing peculiarities with respect to common models of urban dispersion typical of Northern and Western Europe. Policies aimed at containing urban dispersion may definitely benefit from a local-based definition of sprawl, considering the specificity of form-function relationships and the underlying socioeconomic context.},

Because central governments are not able to discern these differences fully, they seek to achieve their policy objectives by relying on decentralized mechanisms that use local information. Household and individual characteristics within communities can also vary substantially. A growing body of theoretical literature suggests that inequality within communities can influence policy outcomes in ways that are either harmful or helpful, depending on the circumstances. Until recently, empirical investigations into the impact of inequality have been held back by a lack of systematic evidence on community-level inequality. This study uses household survey and population census data to estimate per capita consumption inequality within communities in three developing economies. It finds that communities vary markedly in their degree of inequality. It also shows that there should be no presumption that inequality is less severe in poor communities. The kind of community-level inequality estimates generated here can be used in designing and evaluating decentralized antipoverty programs. {\textcopyright} The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development/The World Bank 2004; all rights reserved.},

We try out practical ways of adjusting standard errors of the regression coefficients to reflect the error introduced by using imputed, rather than actual, welfare indicators. These are illustrated by regression experiments based on data from Ecuador. For regressions with imputed variables on the left-hand side, we argue that essentially the same aggregate relationships would be found with either actual or imputed variables.

In this article, we develop a stochastic model of urban structure to formally account for uncertainty arising from less predictable events. Standard practice has been to calibrate the spatial interaction models independently and to explore the dynamics through simulation. We present two significant results that will be transformative for both elements. First, we represent the structural variables through a single potential function and develop stochastic differential equations to model the evolution. Second, we show that the parameters of the spatial interaction model can be estimated from the structure alone, independently of flow data, using the Bayesian inferential framework. The posterior distribution is doubly intractable and poses significant computational challenges that we overcome using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We demonstrate our methodology with a case study on the London, UK, retail system.},

Half the increase in urban land across the world over the next 20 years will occur in Asia, with the most extensive change expected to take place in India and China Urban areas modify their local and regional climate through the urban heat island effect and by altering precipitation patterns, which together will have significant impacts on net primary production, ecosystem health, and biodiversity Urban expansion will heavily draw on natural resources, including water, on a global scale, and will often consume prime agricultural land, with knock-on effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services elsewhere Future urban expansion will often occur in areas where the capacity for formal governance is restricted, which will constrain the protection of biodiversity and management of ecosystem services.},

First, cross-sectional employment outcomes by age (and education) are presented for four 2020 months (February, April, June and October, as measured in NIDS-CRAM). Thereafter, employment dynamics over the year are described and contrasted with employment dynamics from five pre-COVID years (2010-2014, as measured in panels based on the QLFS). We find that several aspects of the churning observed in 2020 far exceed transitions from these benchmark years, with a greater proportion of those without employment at the beginning of the year finding work by the end of the year and much higher job attainment among youth. Finally, we analyse employment outcomes during 2020 according to individuals' employment history between 2012 and 2017 (as captured in NIDS waves 3 to 5). We find that employment history correlated strongly with 2020 employment outcomes: individuals with stronger employment histories were more likely to remain stably employed, or, among the non-employed, to find work. This shows the importance of historical context in understanding the employment effects of COVID-19.},

This paper presents the results of a pilot study, which deployed a qualitative GIS technique to analyse the effectiveness of walked interviews in capturing data relating to people's understanding of place. We give an account of the walking interview exploring two issues: the relationship between what people say and where they say it; and qualitative and quantitative differences between data generated by walking and sedentary interviews. Our results indicate that the data generated through walking interviews are profoundly informed by the landscapes in which they take place, emphasising the importance of environmental features in shaping discussions. We also demonstrate a measureable difference between walking and sedentary techniques in the production of rich place narratives both in terms of their quantity and spatial specificity to the study area. The paper concludes by acknowledging that a technocentric analysis of place runs the risk of emphasising locational above humanistic elements, but argues that, done sensitively, a qualitative GIS approach offers great potential for engaging planners and policy makers with the importance of local connections to place. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

In doing so it debunks arguments by Gordon and Richardson in favor of Los Angeles-style sprawl. Sprawl is not suburbanization generally, but rather forms of suburban development that lack accessibility and open space. Sprawl is not a natural response to market forces, but a product of subsidies and other market imperfections. The costs of sprawl are borne by all of us, not just those creating it, and include inflated public spending, loss of resource lands, and a waning sense of community. The only realistic cure for sprawl is active planning of the sort practiced almost everywhere except the United States (and beginning to appear here out of necessity). {\textcopyright} 1997 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {Problem: Localities and states are turning to land planning and urban design for help in reducing automobile use and related social and environmental costs. The effects of such strategies on travel demand have not been generalized in recent years from the multitude of available studies. Purpose: We conducted a meta-analysis of the built environment-travel literature existing at the end of 2009 in order to draw generalizable conclusions for practice. We aimed to quantify effect sizes, update earlier work, include additional outcome measures, and address the methodological issue of self-selection. Methods: We computed elasticities for individual studies and pooled them to produce weighted averages. Results and conclusions: Travel variables are generally inelastic with respect to change in measures of the built environment. Of the environmental variables considered here, none has a weighted average travel elasticity of absolute magnitude greater than 0.39, and most are much less. Still, the combined effect of several such variables on travel could be quite large. Consistent with prior work, we find that vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is most strongly related to measures of accessibility to destinations and secondarily to street network design variables. Walking is most strongly related to measures of land use diversity, intersection density, and the number of destinations within walking distance. Bus and train use are equally related to proximity to transit and street network design variables, with land use diversity a secondary factor. Surprisingly, we find population and job densities to be only weakly associated with travel behavior once these other variables are controlled. Takeaway for practice: The elasticities we derived in this meta-analysis may be used to adjust outputs of travel or activity models that are otherwise insensitive to variation in the built environment, or be used in sketch planning applications ranging from climate action plans to health impact assessments. However, because sample sizes are small, and very few studies control for residential preferences and attitudes, we cannot say that planners should generalize broadly from our results. While these elasticities are as accurate as currently possible, they should be understood to contain unknown error and have unknown confidence intervals. They provide a base, and as more built-environment/travel studies appear in the planning literature, these elasticities should be updated and refined. {\textcopyright} American Planning Association, Chicago, IL.},

The chance of upward mobility for Americans is just half that of the citizens of the Denmark and many other European countries. In addition to other influences, the built environment may contribute to the low rate of upward mobility in the U.S. This study tests the relationship between urban sprawl and upward mobility for commuting zones in the U.S. We examine potential pathways through which sprawl may have an effect on mobility. We use structural equation modeling to account for both direct and indirect effects of sprawl on upward mobility. We find that upward mobility is significantly higher in compact areas than sprawling areas. The direct effect, which we attribute to better job accessibility in more compact commuting zones, is stronger than the indirect effects. Of the indirect effects, only one, through the mediating variable income segregation, is significant.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis of a Hierarchy of the Sciences with physical sciences at the top, social sciences at the bottom, and biological sciences in-between is nearly 200 years old. This order is intuitive and reflected in many features of academic life, but whether it reflects the ''hardness'' of scientific research-i.e., the extent to which research questions and results are determined by data and theories as opposed to non-cognitive factors-is controversial. This study analysed 2434 papers published in all disciplines and that declared to have tested a hypothesis. It was determined how many papers reported a ''positive'' (full or partial) or ''negative'' support for the tested hypothesis. If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in ''softer'' sciences should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly defined. Controlling for observed differences between pure and applied disciplines, and between papers testing one or several hypotheses, the odds of reporting a positive result were around 5 times higher among papers in the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry and Economics and Business compared to Space Science, 2.3 times higher in the domain of social sciences compared to the physical sciences, and 3.4 times higher in studies applying behavioural and social methodologies on people compared to physical and chemical studies on non-biological material. In all comparisons, biological studies had intermediate values. These results suggest that the nature of hypotheses tested and the logical and methodological rigour employed to test them vary systematically across disciplines and fields, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and possibly other factors (e.g., a field's level of historical and/or intellectual development). On the other hand, these results support the scientific status of the social sciences against claims that they are completely subjective, by showing that, when they adopt a scientific approach to discovery, they differ from the natural sciences only by a matter of degree. {\textcopyright} 2010 Daniele Fanelli.},

Three concepts capture the core of this field: Urban Ecosystem Services (UES, benefits humans derived from urban nature), Green Infrastructure (GI, inter\- connected networks of green space), and Nature-Based Solutions (NBS, actions to protect, manage and restore ecosystems that address societal challenges). Integrating these three fields helps break down disciplinary barriers and leverage their strengths to achieve urban sustainability. However, how to integrate them to promote urban sustainability is still unclear. Here we present a bibliometric analysis of 13,307 English papers published in global SCI journals (i.e., indexed by Web of Science) during 1990{\textendash}2022. We found that (1) UES and GI have entered the exponential growth phase since 2014, while NBS is still in the emerging phase. (2) UES themes focus on urban social-ecological system mechanisms. Both the GI and NBS themes focus on using specific green space types to address specific sustainability challenges, but the GI emphasizes a planning perspective while NBS is a broader umbrella concept that includes more actions. (3) UES, GI, and NBS originated from different academic backgrounds, but have learned from each other and influenced each other in the process of development, forming a stable cooperation network. Our findings suggest that the evolution from UES and GI to NBS not only represents a change in terminology but also marks the efforts of different fields to achieve urban sustainability. Moving forward, these three fields must identify their respective ecological niches and explore potential synergies to enhance urban sustainability. The identified unique features, advantageous themes, interconnection points, and collaborating networks can work as a basis for their integration.},

This special issue on knowledge systems for urban resilience explores the social practices that produce, validate, circulate, and use information, data, and expertise to enable institutions to adapt to the unpredictable and highly dynamic conditions of the Anthropocene. We are particularly interested in the relationship between the social organization of knowledge production and ways that cities can build urban resilience to extreme weather events associated with climate change. Through a combination of conceptual and case study analyses of how knowledge systems work in cities, we argue that building adaptive capacity requires changing the practices, rules, expectations, and underlying power relations in the production and use of knowledge.},

However, the uncertainties associated with MCDA techniques are inevitable and model outcomes are open to multiple types of uncertainty. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. We access the uncertainty of landslide susceptibility maps produced with GIS-MCDA techniques. A new spatially-explicit approach and Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) are employed to assess the uncertainties associated with two MCDA techniques, namely Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) and Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) implemented in GIS. The methodology is composed of three different phases. First, weights are computed to express the relative importance of factors (criteria) for landslide susceptibility. Next, the uncertainty and sensitivity of landslide susceptibility is analyzed as a function of weights using Monte Carlo Simulation and Global Sensitivity Analysis. Finally, the results are validated using a landslide inventory database and by applying DST. The comparisons of the obtained landslide susceptibility maps of both MCDA techniques with known landslides show that the AHP outperforms OWA. However, the OWA-generated landslide susceptibility map shows lower uncertainty than the AHP-generated map. The results demonstrate that further improvement in the accuracy of GIS-based MCDA can be achieved by employing an integrated uncertainty-sensitivity analysis approach, in which the uncertainty of landslide susceptibility model is decomposed and attributed to model's criteria weights. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

In rural counties of the Corn Belt, we find a statistically significant relationship between changes in net outmigration and climate-driven changes in crop yields, with an estimated semi-elasticity of about -0.17, i.e., a 1\% decrease in yields leads to a 0.17\% net reduction of the population through migration. This effect is primarily driven by young adults. We do not detect a response for senior citizens, nor for the general population in eastern counties outside the Corn Belt. Applying this semi-elasticity to predicted yield changes under the B2 scenario of the Hadley III model, we project that, holding other factors constant, climate change would on average induce 3.7\% of the adult population (ages 15-59) to leave rural counties of the Corn Belt in the medium term (2020-2049) compared to the 1960-1989 baseline, with the possibility of a much larger migration response in the long term (2077-2099). Since there is uncertainty about future warming, we also present projections for a range of uniform climate change scenarios in temperature or precipitation.},

Wefind that the fabricationwould not have affected our univariate and cross-sectional estimates meaningfully, but would have led us to reach substantially different conclusions when implementing panel estimators.We estimate that the data quality investigation in this survey had a benefit-cost ratio of at least 24, andwas thus easily justifiable.},

  abstract = {Urban Morphometrics (UMM) is an expanding area of urban studies that aims at representing and measuring objectively the physical form of cities to support evidence-based research. An essential step in its development is the identification of a suitable spatial unit of analysis, where suitability is determined by its degree of reliability, universality, accessibility and significance in capturing essential urban form patterns. In Urban Morphology such unit is found in the plot, a fundamental component in the morphogenetic of urban settlements. However, the plot is a conceptually and analytically ambiguous concept and a kind of spatial information often unavailable or inconsistently represented across geographies, issues that limit its reliability and universality and hence its suitability for Urban Morphometric applications. This calls for alternative methods of deriving a spatial unit able to convey reliable plot-scale information, possibly comparable with that provided by plots. This paper presents Morphological Tessellation (MT), an objectively and universally applicable method that derives a spatial unit named Morphological Cell (MC) from widely available data on building footprint only and tests its informational value as proxy data in capturing plot-scale spatial properties of urban form. Using the city of Zurich (CH) as case study we compare MT to the cadastral layer on a selection of morphometric characters capturing different geometrical and configurational properties of urban form, to test the degree of informational similarity between MT and cadastral plots. Findings suggest that MT can be considered an efficient informational proxy for cadastral plots for many of the tested morphometric characters, that there are kinds of plot-scale information only plots can provide, as well as kinds only morphological tessellation can provide. Overall, there appears to be clear scope for application of MT as fundamental spatial unit of analysis in Urban Morphometrics, opening the way to large-scale urban morphometric analysis.},

(2) Who gains and who loses, and by which mechanisms of power? (3) Is this development desirable? (4) What, if anything, should we do about it? A central task of phronetic planning research is to provide concrete examples and detailed narratives of the ways in which power and values work in planning and with what consequences to whom, and to suggest how relations of power and values could be changed to work with other consequences. Insofar as planning situations become clear, they are clarified by detailed stories of who is doing what to whom. Clarifications of that kind are a principal concern for phronetic planning research and provide the main link to praxis. {\textcopyright} 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.},

The first proposition is that one can observe in the work of the new generation of economic historians a departure from the past sufficient to justify a title like new economic history. The departure is not to be found in the realm of subject matter. The new generation has not turned away from the traditional theme of its discipline. The central interest of the new economic historians is still the description and explanation of economic growth. This continuity with the past holds in the small as well as in the large. The novel element in the work of the new economic historians is their approach to measurement and theory. Economic history has always had a quantitative orientation. But much of the past work on economic data was limited to the location and the simple classification of the numerical information contained in government and business records. While continuing this pursuit, the new economic history places its primary emphasis on reconstructing measurements which might have existed in the past but are no longer extant, on the recombination of primary data in a manner which enables them to obtain measurements that were never before made, and on finding methods of measuring economic phenomena that cannot be measured directly. In performing these tasks, the new economic historians draw on virtually the whole gamut of the theoretical and statistical models of economics. The second proposition is that the new economic history represents a reunification of economic history with economic theory and thus brings to an end the century-old split between these two branches of economics.},

  abstract = {The author reviews five generations of views of theory-practice tensions, and explores their implications to socio-ecological practice research. Concerns with wicked problems led to considerations of argumentative planning; questions of resolving conflicting arguments led to process designs of mediated-negotiations. Ongoing concerns with deliberation reveal the dangers of deliberative malpractices. The pragmatic imperative to act in fluid, complex, and contested settings requires creative and practically situated improvisation. 1 The challenge of doing socio-ecological practice research and five views of theory-practice tensions In this essay, I hope to respond productively to Wei-Ning Xiang's provocative inaugural essay on "Ecopracticology" (Xiang 2019). He argues there, in effect, that doing socio-ecological practice research confronts at least two major challenges. The first is to build better theory from practice. The second, of course, is to encourage ever better practice on the ground. These are persisting challenges because too much of our academic theorizing seems to have little to do with practice at all, and too many of our practice studies seem not to advance any theoretical understanding either. The result is that in many of our planning, design and environmental policy-related fields, there seem to be two worlds with little to do with each other-the world of the theorists and the world of the practitioners, and the two seem rarely to meet. That "two-worlds problem" raises the set of issues I wish now to address: How can we better understand the relationships , the gaps and the connections, between knowledge and action, theory and practice in our applied fields-so that we can actually improve socio-ecological practice research and, ultimately, improve socio-ecological practice as well? With these problems often in mind in my own work, I have tried for many years to develop a theoretically informed, but accessible body of practice research that I have called a "critical pragmatism" (Forester 1999, p. 22; 2017, pp. 280-295). In what follows, though, I draw a series of lessons from the intellectual history of the fields of urban planning and public policy, and I map out five generations of thought-a development, if not an evolution-of ways that we might understand the uneasy relationships between theory and practice. Each of these five generations has its implications for socio-ecological practice research, implications and lessons that I will summarize by way of conclusion. The five views of theory-practice tensions to follow are these. The "first generation" view was set out by planning scholars Horst Rittel and Melvin Webber in their classic statement of the so-called wicked problems that confronted professional experts (and the rest of us) with truly perplexing dilemmas. In the face of such wickedness, though, Rittel and Webber did not despair altogether-and they actually pointed toward, but did not really develop, what they called a "second genera-tion" approach, one of argumentative planning. The problems of practice that arose from that approach-problems that were},

This paper examines the long-run development of industrial wage inequality in Latin America from a global comparative perspective. We find that wage inequality was comparatively modest during the first half of the twentieth century, but rising much faster during the post-war era than in other industrial countries. In-depth analyses of wage inequality trends in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile confirm this pattern, but also reveal notable country peculiarities. In Argentina and Chile, trend breaks coincided with large political-institutional shocks while in Brazil, wage inequality increased unabated under the wage regulation policies of successive post-war administrations. We argue that without taking national policies with respect to education and the labor market into account, economic theory cannot explain "Latin American" patterns of wage inequality. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Nature-based solutions are proliferating in European cities over the past years as viable solutions to urban challenges such as climate change, urban degeneration and aging infrastructures. With evidence amounting about nature-based solutions, there is a need to translate knowledge about nature-based solutions to future policy and planning. In this paper, we analysed fifteen cases of nature-based solutions' experiments across 11 European cities. What makes our case studies stand out is the balanced focus between ecosystem and social benefits in contrast to many published cases on nature-based solutions that have a weighted focus on the climate benefits. From a cross-case comparative analysis we draw seven overarching lessons related to all stages of proofof-concept and implementation of nature-based solutions in cities: (a) nature-based solutions need to be aesthetically appealing to citizens, (b) nature-based solutions create new green urban commons, (c) experimenting with nature-based solutions requires trust in the local government and in experimentation process itself, (d) cocreation of nature-based solutions requires diversity and learning from social innovation, (e) nature-based solutions require collaborative governance, (f) an inclusive narrative of mission for nature-based solutions can enable integration to many urban agendas and (g) design nature-based solutions so as to learn and replicate them on the long-term. The lessons we draw show that nature-based solutions require multiple disciplines for their design, diversity (of settings) for co-creation and recognition of the place-based transformative potential of nature-based solutions as `superior' to grey infrastructure. We further discern that urban planners need to have an open approach to collaborative governance of nature-based solutions that allows learning with and about new appealing designs, perceptions and images of nature from different urban actors, allows forming of new institutions for operating and maintaining nature-based solutions to ensure inclusivity, livability and resilience.},

  abstract = {We assess the utility of synthetic control, a recently developed empirical methodology, for applications in organizational research. Synthetic control acts as a bridge between qualitative and quantitative research methods by enabling researchers to estimate treatment effects in contexts with small samples or few occurrences of a phenomenon or treatment event. The method constructs a counterfactual of a focal firm, or other observational unit, based on an objectively weighted combination of a small number of comparable but untreated firms. By comparing the firm's actual performance to its counterfactual replica without treatment, synthetic control estimates, under certain assumptions, the magnitude and direction of treatment effects. We illustrate and critique the method in the context of the U.S. auto industry by estimating (a) the effect of government intervention in Chrysler's management from 2009 to 2011 on its sales volumes and (b) the impact of Toyota's 2010 ``acceleration crisis'' on Camry sales.},

A multinomial logit model is employed to test hypotheses concerning the cyclic model of metropolitan region development. The results support empirical evidence of the spatial dispersal of high-rise buildings, indicating an initial process of reconcentration in the Tel-Aviv metropolitan pattern. The study concludes that intensive high-rise building is expected to develop extensively in the future, particularly in the core and inner-ring areas. The dispersal of this construction indicates a classic negative gradient pattern, moving from the core area towards the outskirts of the metropolitan region. In contrast, the classic pattern between centre and fringes does not hold within the built-up area of the metropolitan region.},

In high-income countries, there is consistent evidence of a positive albeit decreasing link between city size and economic growth. In contrast, the relationship does not hold for developing countries, for which most of the coefficients display insignificant results or point towards a negative connection between both factors.},

It aims to overcome the limitations of existing empirical literature by building a new urban population dataset that allows the construction of a set of Herfindahl-Hirschman-Indices which capture a country's urban structure in a more nuanced way than the indicators used hitherto. We find that, contrary to the general perception, urban concentration levels have on average decreased or remained stable (depending on indicator). However, these averages camouflage diverging trends across countries. The results of the econometric analysis suggest that there is no uniform relationship between urban concentration and economic growth. Urban concentration is beneficial for economic growth in high-income countries, while this effect does not hold for developing countries. The results differ from previous analyses that generally underscore the benefits of urban concentration at low levels of economic development. The results are robust to accounting for reverse causality through IV analysis, using exogenous geographic factors as instruments.},

Many statistical tools exist for analyzing their structure but, surprisingly, there are few techniques for exploratory visual display, and for depicting the patterns of relations among variables in such matrices directly, particularly when the number of variables is moderately large. This article describes a set of techniques we subsume under the name "corrgram," based on two main schemes: (a) Rendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude. We consider some of the properties of several iconic representations, in relation to the kind of task to be performed. (b) Reordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that "similar" variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception. In addition, the extension of this visualization to matrices for conditional independence and partial independence is described and illustrated, and we provide an easily used SAS implementation of these methods.},

As indicated by its subtitle (i.e., A General Theory Relating to Industrial Location, Market Areas, Land Use, Trade, and Urban Structure), the book was written with the aim of nothing less than initiating the development of a general theory of location and space-economy, embracing the total spatial array of economic activities. Such a theory was supposed to include both the traditional general equilibrium theory and the international trade theory as special cases. In this paper, first I shall discuss what were his possible ideas on the general theory, given the state of economic science at that time, and what were the main contributions of Location and Space-Economy in initiating the development of such a theory. Second, I review the major contributions of subsequent works by Professor Isard and other scholars from the viewpoint of the development of the general theory. Finally, I discuss possible future directions in developing such a theory.},

Japan has excellent data and relatively uniform institutions since World War II, which allow us to track its spatial evolution and detail its key features today. For Japan we show how structural shifts in the national economy involved major transformations of the regional structure of economic activity. We address a central policy issue, the high extent of urban agglomeration in Tokyo. Then we turn to the details of the spatial distribution of industrial activity across cities, to see what general patterns hold and what they imply for our understanding of the role of different cities in the urban hierarchy. For China the approach is different. With the radical institutional changes since 1978 moving China away from being a planned economy, there is little consistency in data definitions and coverage over time and less detailed data are available. We focus on the last decade and on policy issues. We observe that Chinese cities tend to be overcapitalized and undersized, with strong spatial biases to policies, concerning migration, capital allocations, infrastructure allocations and location of FDI. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We first review the empirical evidence on the upper tail of city size distribution. We offer a novel discussion of the important econometric issues in the characterization of the distribution. We then discuss the theories that have been advanced to explain the approximate constancy of the distribution across very different economic and social systems, emphasizing both barebone statistical theories and more developed economic theories. We discuss the more recent work on the determinants of urban growth and, in particular, growth regressions, economic explanations of city size distributions other than Gibrat's law, consequences of major shocks (quasi natural experiments), and the dynamics of U.S. urban evolution. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Cities and their transportation systems become increasingly complex and multimodal as they grow, and it is natural to wonder whether it is possible to quantitatively characterize our difficulty navigating in them and whether such navigation exceeds our cognitive limits. A transition between different search strategies for navigating in metropolitan maps has been observed for large, complex metropolitan networks. This evidence suggests the existence of a limit associated with cognitive overload and caused by a large amount of information that needs to be processed. In this light, we analyzed the world's 15 largest metropolitan networks and estimated the information limit for determining a trip in a transportation system to be on the order of 8 bits. Similar to the "Dunbar number," which represents a limit to the size of an individual's friendship circle, our cognitive limit suggests that maps should not consist of more than 250 connection points to be easily readable. We also show that including connections with other transportation modes dramatically increases the information needed to navigate in multilayer transportation networks. In large cities such as New York, Paris, and Tokyo, more than 80\% of the trips are above the 8-bit limit. Multimodal transportation systems in large cities have thus already exceeded human cognitive limits and, consequently, the traditional view of navigation in cities has to be revised substantially.},

  abstract = {Urbanisation is a worldwide phenomenon, yet its patterns vary significantly from one region to another. While the rate is slowing down in the Global North, the opposite is happening in parts of the Global South. This paper assesses the trajectory of urbanisation in Southern Africa over the last 40 years. This is one of the fastest urbanising regions of the world. It analyses four themes: cities' growth rates, size distribution, built-up areas and urban density. Several findings suggest that urbanisation has become slightly more manageable since the turn of the century. There has been a gradual decline in the urban population growth rate, the number of cities is increasing more slowly than before, and the urban footprint is expanding more slowly. South Africa and Zimbabwe exemplify these trends. Other findings give greater cause for concern and warrant more government attention. Growth is unevenly distributed across the size spectrum, with the largest cities growing much faster than smaller cities. In addition, the highest urban densities are in the poorest countries, suggesting that density takes the form of overcrowded informal settlements rather than liveable and productive places. The DRC and Mozambique exemplify these challenges.},

Using a microscopic traffic simulator, the solutions obtained by our algorithm are evaluated in the context of two large and heterogeneous metropolitan areas located in the cities of M{\'a}laga and Sevilla (in Spain). In comparison with cycle programs predefined by experts (close to real ones), our proposal obtains significant profits in terms of two main indicators: the number of vehicles that reach their destinations on time and the global trip time. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Is infrastructure construction an effective way to boost employment in distressed local labor markets? Using new geographically detailed data on highway construction that was funded bythe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, I study how road construction projects affect local employment growth. The method for allocating funds across space facilitates a plausible selection-on-observables strategy. I find that highway funding impacted construction employment at the county level: A dollar of additional Recovery Act spending on local construction increased local construction payrolls by thirty cents during the five years after the Act's passage. The magnitude of this effect matches the national labor share of construction revenues, suggesting that targeted spending did not crowd out other local construction. These effects are most pronounced in counties with smaller populations and smaller shares of residents that commute to outside counties for work. However, when testing for general equilibrium effects on local employment and payroll aggregates, I find effects close to zero, with very wide confidence intervals across all specifications. Although the Recovery Act was an intervention significant enough to have a sizable impact on the construction sector in counties with low mobility, these findings suggest that the local variation in highway spending was too small relative to baseline regional volatility to detect a ``local multiplier'' effect impacting jobs outside of construction.},

  abstract = {The comparative advantage of many cities is based on their efficiency in the production of `functions', e.g., business services such as finance, law, engineering, or similar functions that are used by firms in a wide range of sectors. Firms that use these functions may choose to source them locally, or to purchase them from other cities. The former case gives rise to cities developing a pattern of sectoral specialization, and the latter a pattern of functional specialization. A two-city country trades with the larger world, and workers within the country are mobile between the two cities. Productivity in a given function varies across cities, giving rise to urban comparative advantage. This may be due to exogenous technological differences (Ricardian) or to city- and function-specific scale economies. Sectors differ in the intensity with which they use different functions, giving rise to a pattern of sectoral and functional specialisation. We generate a number of economic insights, and examine the model's predictions empirically over a 20-30-year period for US states. As geographic fragmentation costs fall, both our theory and empirical analysis show that sector concentration and regional specialization fall for sectors and rise for functions (occupations).},

A comparison is made between a general G statistic and Moran's I for similar hypothetical and empirical conditions. The empirical work includes studies of sudden infant death syndrome by county in North Carolina and dwelling unit prices in metropolitan San Diego by zip-code districts. Results indicate that G statistics should be used in conjunction with I in order to identify characteristics of patterns not revealed by the I statistic alone and, specifically, the Gi and Gi* statistics enable us to detect local ``pockets'' of dependence that may not show up when using global statistics. 1992 The Ohio State University},

We deal with the potential endogeneity of scheme location by identifying the effects of changes in accessibility from variation across small-scale geographical areas close to the scheme. We find substantial positive effects on area level employment and number of establishments. For existing establishments we find increases in output per worker, wages and use of intermediate inputs. A plausible interpretation is that new transport infrastructure attracts transport intensive establishments to an area, and also leads to some reorganization of production in existing businesses.},

The causes and consequences of environmental change can, of course, be measured at different levels and along multiple scales. While the natural sciences have long understood the importance of scale, research regarding scale in the social sciences has been less explicit, less precise, and more variable. The growing need for interdisciplinary work across the natural/social science divide, however, demands that each achieve some common understandings about scaling issues. This survey seeks to facilitate the dialogue between natural and social scientists by reviewing some of the more important aspects of the concept of scale employed in the social sciences, especially as they relate to the human dimensions of global environmental change.

We compare these two data sources for predicting GDP, especially at the second subnational level, for Indonesia, China and South Africa. The DMSP data are a poor proxy for GDP outside of cities. The gap in predictive performance between DMSP data and VIIRS data is especially apparent at lower levels of the spatial hierarchy, such as for counties, and for lower density areas. The city lights-GDP relationship is twice as noisy with DMSP data than with VIIRS data. Spatial inequality is considerably understated with DMSP data, especially for the urban sector and in higher density areas. A Pareto adjustment to correct for top-coding in DMSP data has a modest effect but still understates spatial inequality and misses key features of economic activity in big cities.},

These satellites are able to quantify physical geographic phenomena associated with the movements of the earth's surface (earthquakes, mass movements), water (floods, tsunamis, storms), and fire (wildfires). Most of these satellites contain active or passive sensors that can be utilized by the scientific community for the remote sensing of natural hazards over a number of spatial and temporal scales. The most useful satellite imagery for the assessment of earthquake damage comes from high-resolution (0.6 m to 1 m pixel size) passive sensors and moderate resolution active sensors that can quantify the vertical and horizontal movement of the earth's surface. High-resolution passive sensors have been used successfully to assess flood damage while predictive maps of flood vulnerability areas are possible based on physical variables collected from passive and active sensors. Recent moderate resolution sensors are able to provide near real-time data on fires and provide quantitative data used in fire behavior models. Limitations currently exist due to atmospheric interference, pixel resolution, and revisit times. However, a number of new microsatellites and constellations of satellites will be launched in the next five years that contain increased resolution (0. 5 m to 1 m pixel resolution for active sensors) and revisit times (daily {$<$} 2.5 m resolution images from passive sensors) that will significantly improve our ability to assess and predict natural hazards from space. {\textcopyright} 2007 SAGE Publications.},

  abstract = {The ways in which seabirds navigate over very large spatial scales remain poorly understood. While olfactory and visual information can provide guidance over short distances, their range is often limited to 100s km, far below the navigational capacity of wide-ranging animals such as albatrosses. Infrasound is a form of low-frequency sound that propagates for 1,000s km in the atmosphere. In marine habitats, its association with storms and ocean surface waves could in effect make it a useful cue for anticipating environmental conditions that favor or hinder flight or be associated with profitable foraging patches. However, behavioral responses of wild birds to infrasound remain untested. Here, we explored whether wandering albatrosses,               Diomedea exulans               , respond to microbarom infrasound at sea. We used Global Positioning System tracks of 89 free-ranging albatrosses in combination with acoustic modeling to investigate whether albatrosses preferentially orientate toward areas of `loud' microbarom infrasound on their foraging trips. We found that in addition to responding to winds encountered in situ, albatrosses moved toward source regions associated with higher sound pressure levels. These findings suggest that albatrosses may be responding to long-range infrasonic cues. As albatrosses depend on winds and waves for soaring flight, infrasonic cues may help albatrosses to identify environmental conditions that allow them to energetically optimize flight over long distances. Our results shed light on one of the great unresolved mysteries in nature, navigation in seemingly featureless ocean environments.},

Thereafter, a systematic review of the literature is proposed to identify the causes of the rise in popularity of a sustainable food system theme, the potential consequences of the COVID-19 crisis for the food system (targeting the production, consumption and waste disposal phases) and possible solutions, focusing on the circular economy. Challenges and opportunities for policymakers in the short and long term are discussed. A holistic approach is advocated, as the global food system is intimately connected with society and requires deep cooperation among nation states and economic actors.},

We examine this presumption by finding the commuting pattern for the Los Angeles region in 1980 which would minimise average commuting time or distance, given the actual spatial distributions of job and housing locations. We find that the amount of commuting required by these distributions is far less than actual commuting, and that variations in required commuting across job locations only weakly explain variations in actual commuting. We conclude that other factors must be more important to location decisions than commuting cost, and that policies aimed at changing the jobs-housing balance will have only a minor effect on commuting. {\textcopyright} 1993, Sage Publications.

Lower probabilities of arrest and a lower probability of recognition are features of urban life, but these factors seem to explain at most one-fifth of the urban crime effect.

As such, they exist to eliminate transportation costs for goods, people and ideas and transportation technologies dictate urban form. In the 21st century, the dominant form of city living is based on the automobile and this form is sometimes called sprawl. In this essay, we document that sprawl is ubiquitous and that it is continuing to expand. Using a variety of evidence, we argue that sprawl is not the result of explicit government policies or bad urban planning, but rather the inexorable product of car-based living. Sprawl has been associated with significant improvements in quality of living, and the environmental impacts of sprawl have been offset by technological change. Finally, we suggest that the primary social problem associated with sprawl is the fact that some people are left behind because they do not earn enough to afford the cars that this form of living requires. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Transportation spending has historically done much to make or break particular places, but current transportation spending subsidizes low-income, low-density places where agglomeration effects are likely to be weakest. Most large-scale place-oriented policies have had little discernable impact. Some targeted policies such as Empowerment Zones seem to have an effect but are expensive relative to their achievements. The greatest promise for a national place-based policy lies in impeding the tendency of highly productive areas to restrict their own growth through restrictions on land use.},

This condition implies that research on cities is different from research on countries, and that work on places within countries needs to consider population, income, and housing prices simultaneously. Housing supply elasticity will determine whether urban success reveals itself in the form of more people or higher incomes. Urban economists generally accept the existence of agglomeration economies, which exist when productivity rises with density, but estimating the magnitude of those economies is difficult. Some manufacturing firms cluster to reduce the costs of moving goods, but this force no longer appears to be important in driving urban success. Instead, modern cities are far more dependent on the role that density can play in speeding the flow of ideas. Finally, urban economics has some insights to offer related topics such as growth theory, national income accounts, public economics, and housing prices. (JEL R11, R23, R31, R32).},

Crime rates are higher in more unequal cities; people in unequal cities are more likely to say that they are unhappy. There is a negative association between local inequality and the growth of city-level income and population, once we control for the initial distribution of skills. High levels of mobility across cities mean that city-level inequality should not be studied with the same analytical tools used to understand national inequality, and policy approaches need to reflect the urban context. Urban inequality reflects the choices of more and less skilled people to live together in particular areas. City-level skill inequality can explain about one-third of the variation in city-level income inequality, while skill inequality is itself explained by historical schooling patterns and immigration. Local income also reflects the substantial differences in the returns to skill across, which are related to local industrial patterns. {\textcopyright} 2009, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Together, these features, particularly at their most extreme, produce the classic shape of an asset bubble. In this chapter, we review the stylized facts of housing bubbles and discuss theories that can potentially explain events like the boom-bust cycles of the 2000s. One set of theories assumes rationality and uses idiosyncratic features of the housing market, such as intensive search and short-selling constraints, to explain the stylized facts. Cheap credit provides a particularly common rationalization for price booms, but temporary periods of low interest rates will not explain massive price swings in simple rational models. An incorrectly underpriced default option can make rational bubbles more likely. Many nonrational explanations for real estate bubbles exist, but the most promising theories emphasize some form of trend chasing, which in turn reflects boundedly rational learning.},

However, big data will not solve large urban social science questions on its own. Big urban data has the most value for the study of cities when it allows measurement of the previously opaque, or when it can be coupled with exogenous shocks to people or place. We describe a number of new urban data sources and illustrate how they can be used to improve the study and function of cities. We first show how Google Street View images can be used to predict income in New York City, suggesting that similar imagery data can be used to map wealth and poverty in previously unmeasured areas of the developing world. We then discuss how survey techniques can be improved to better measure willingness to pay for urban amenities. Finally, we explain how Internet data is being used to improve the quality of city services. (JEL R1, C8, C18).},

The paper is focused on the relationship between nature-based solutions and spatial realities, based on reciprocity among natural processes and urban patterns, emphasising the recognition of using and mimicking natural processes in urban environments. A classification framework as a form of knowledge aggregation is suggested. A matrix that simultaneously addresses the role of natural processes in nature-based solutions and the ability of such processes to deliver results for improving urban environments is proposed. Accordingly, there are three characteristic groups of solutions suggested, (1) those only using natural processes, (2) those using and mimicking natural processes and (3) those only mimicking natural processes, which implementation potentials are commented against four different types of urban patterns, to show what group of the nature-based solutions may best suit any type of spatial agglomeration. Beside green infrastructure as currently the most often addressed manifestation of nature-based solutions in cities, the paper reflects also on the physical processes as inevitable parts of nature. In relation to urban planning, sites and their characteristics are seen as a crucial aspect of nature-based solutions. The arguments are built upon exhaustive literature and case studies review, resulted in the matrix showing the matching relations among nature-based solutions and societal challenges aiming for better urban environment. Additionally, there are also sets of recommendations for bridging the policy-implementation gaps to bring nature-based solutions closer to urban planning, suggested.},

But while the Lewis model contains a powerful and compelling macro narrative, its details have proved somewhat elusive to scholars and students who have followed, and its policy implications are unclear. This paper identifies several key insights of the Lewis model, discusses several different interpretations of the model, and then reviews modern evidence for the central propositions of the model. In closing, we consider the relevance of Lewis for current thinking about development strategies and policies.},

These contrast with ``production cities'' that are more dependent on manufacturing in countries that have industrialized. Consumption cities in resource exporters also appear to perform worse along several measures of welfare. We offer a simple model of structural change that can explain the observed patterns of urbanization and the associated differences in city types. We note that although the development literature often assumes that urbanization is synonymous with industrialization, patterns differ markedly across developing countries. We discuss several possible implications for policy.},

  abstract = {Urban scaling relations characterizing how diverse properties of cities vary on average with their population size have recently been shown to be a general quantitative property of many urban systems around the world. However, in previous studies the statistics of urban indicators were not analyzed in detail, raising important questions about the full characterization of urban properties and how scaling relations may emerge in these larger contexts. Here, we build a self-consistent statistical framework that characterizes the joint probability distributions of urban indicators and city population sizes across an urban system. To develop this framework empirically we use one of the most granular and stochastic urban indicators available, specifically measuring homicides in cities of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, three nations with high and fast changing rates of violent crime. We use these data to derive the conditional probability of the number of homicides per year given the population size of a city. To do this we use Bayes' rule together with the estimated conditional probability of city size given their number of homicides and the distribution of total homicides. We then show that scaling laws emerge as expectation values of these conditional statistics. Knowledge of these distributions implies, in turn, a relationship between scaling and population size distribution exponents that can be used to predict Zipf's exponent from urban indicator statistics. Our results also suggest how a general statistical theory of urban indicators may be constructed from the stochastic dynamics of social interaction processes in cities. {\textcopyright} 2012 Gomez-Lievano et al.},

These data indicate that large cities are more likely to have subways but that subways have an economically insignificant effect on urban population growth. Our data also indicate that subways cause cities to decentralize, although the effect is smaller than previously documented effects of highways on decentralization. For a subset of subway cities we observe panel data describing subway and bus ridership. For those cities we find that a 10\% increase in subway extent causes about a 6\% increase in subway ridership and has no effect on bus ridership.},

Secondly, when the entire distribution is considered using non-parametric methods, it is found that Gibrat's law does not hold exactly in the long term (in general, size affects the variance of the growth process but not its mean). Moreover, the log-normal distribution works well as a description of city size distributions across the whole century when no truncation point is considered. {\textcopyright} 2013 Urban Studies Journal Limited.},

The complex properties of such systems make modelling an indispensable tool for their description and analysis. Human actors play a pivotal role in SESs, but their interactions with each other and their environment are often underrepresented in SES modelling. We argue that more attention should be given to social aspects in models of SESs, but this entails additional kinds of complexity. Modelling choices need to be as transparent as possible, and to be based on analysis of the purposes and limitations of modelling. We recommend thinking in terms of modelling projects rather than single models. Such a project may involve multiple models adopting different modelling methods. We argue that agent-based models (ABMs) are an essential tool in an SES modelling project, but their expressivity, which is their major advantage, also produces problems with model transparency and validation. We propose the use of formal ontologies to make the structure and meaning of models as explicit as possible, facilitating model design, implementation, assessment, comparison and extension.},

Through life history and biographical research they can gain insights into what motivates people to engage in adult learning for social and personal change. Looking at examples taken both from the literature and from four different research studies that the author has engaged in during recent years, some of the benefits, challenges, and possibilities for life history/biographical research are explored in this paper. Both practical aspects, such as how to recruit participants, and more philosophical/methodological concerns such as the importance of recognising how participants use narrative as a means to explore meaning making around their own identity and life course are explored in the discussion. In conclusion, the paper argues that new technologies and emerging forms of artistic representation in life history and biographical research offer opportunities for both educators and participants, as well as other audiences, to explore adult learning experiences connected to social justice.},

  abstract = {Scholarship on Nature-based Solutions (NbS) primarily focuses on the potential for NbS to deliver multiple benefits to humans and biodiversity from networked natural systems. These approaches, if enacted without sensitivity to local contexts and histories, can deepen long standing injustices resulting from the destruction of complex self-organizing ecological systems, the usurpation of Indigenous governance and knowledge, and the prioritization of technical managerial approaches transforming nature into infrastructure. Here we review, synthesize, and critically reflect on existing scholarship on the rise of NbS in New York City, USA, to inform environmental policy in support of just transformations of complex urban systems. To do so, we examine NbS within the context of the social-ecological-technological system (SETS) of NYC. We organize our review and synthesis around three interrelated concepts of justice: Ecological, Indigenous Environmental, and Infrastructural Justice. Ecological Justice entails addressing the harms, needs, and desired futures of ecological actors while identifying synergies with human focused environmental justice concerns and movements. Indigenous Envi\- ronmental Justice requires restoring Indigenous systems of governance and knowledge while making space for a diversity of social-ecological practices of marginalized communities. Infrastructural Justice addresses the his\- torical and ongoing injustices perpetuated through mainstream infrastructure policy and design practice {\textendash}including Environmental Justice concerns {\textendash} which have increasingly turned towards NbS. Without embedding these principles within emergent NbS focused environmental policy agendas seeking just transformations, they will likely recreate utilitarian, anthropocentric, and colonial modes of managing nature as infrastructure. We conclude with a research-to-action agenda for meeting the interdependent needs of urban ecosystems and humans.},

  abstract = {Urban green spaces provide important contributions to enhance climate adaptation, and therefore research in this area has increased exponentially in the last decades. While several studies showed that the morphology and type of living and built elements of urban green spaces greatly affect their performance, a persistent gap between theory and practice continues to pervade the design of green spaces. This study conducts a semi-systematic review of research published in the last decade to investigate to what extent recent research has produced evidence-based outputs rele\- vant to practitioners concerning the design of outdoor urban green spaces in the context of climate adaptation. An innovative design-oriented approach is subsequently applied to critically review evidence-based research outputs considering a comprehensive spectrum of climate im\- pacts and adaptation measures. Our specific objectives are to: i) identify evidence-based research outputs of relevance to practitioners according to type of climatic impact; ii) assess the level of relevance and geographical transferability of such outputs to support the design of urban green spaces; and iii) identify key challenges that might hinder the implementation of evidence-based guidelines. Our results support a call to align research to confront the `wicked' gap between scientific research and implementation in design practice.},

  abstract = {Inequality has emerged as a key development challenge. It holds implications for economic growth and redistribution and translates into power asymmetries that can endanger human rights, create conflict, and embed social exclusion and chronic poverty. For these reasons, it underpins intense public and academic debates and has become a dominant policy concern within many countries and in all multilateral agencies. It is at the core of the seventeen goals of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This book contributes to this important discussion by presenting assessments of the measurement and analysis of global inequality by leading inequality scholars, aligning these to comprehensive reviews of inequality trends in five of the world's largest developing countries{\textemdash}Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and South Africa. Each is a persistently high or newly high inequality context and, with the changing global inequality situation as context, country chapters investigate the main factors shaping their different inequality dynamics. Particular attention is on how broader societal inequalities arising outside of the labour market have intersected with the rapidly changing labour market milieus of the last few decades. Collectively these chapters provide a nuanced discussion of key distributive phenomena like the high concentration of income among the most affluent people, gender inequalities, and social mobility. Substantive tax and social benefit policies that each country implemented to mitigate these inequality dynamics are assessed in detail. The book takes lessons from these contexts back into the global analysis of inequality and social mobility and the policies needed to address inequality.},

  abstract = {South African cities have focused on sustainability as a policy and strategic objective. Nonetheless, realising the transformative potential of fostering sustainable transition pathways is challenging. Our entry point for understanding this impasse is that the ability of cities to transform lies in the opaque spaces between policy rhetoric and implementation. We unpack these policy disjunctures in two ways. Firstly, we posit that the potential of the City to ensure that policy based on progressive and transformative principles is implemented in ways that foster the intended action is tied up with its ability to perform as a learning institution. The transformative role of learning is in turn dependent on accessing the situated tacit knowledge that informs decision-making and action. Secondly, we propose that researching the capacity of the City to learn requires alternative spaces for research and deliberation. To illustrate these arguments, we draw on a knowledge co-production urban experiment in Cape Town to improve the efficacy and analysis of both policy development and implementation. Tacit knowledge surfaced practices that are found to hamper learning within the City. Engaging with identified barriers to learning and change provides alternate entry points for identifying feasible points of leverage to address sustainability disjunctures.},

Lacking such an organization , the field of survey research has evolved through the somewhat independent and uncoordinated contributions of researchers trained as statisticians, psychologists, political scientists, and sociologists. These brief encounters between the survey method and bodies of theory have produced what we know about survey quality today. Such a melange of workers certainly breeds innovation, but it also spawns applications of the method for radically different purposes, suffers severe problems of communication, and produces disagreements about the importance of various components of quality. The status quo in survey research can be described as a set of role pairs, the members of each pair oppositional in their practices with regard to some survey design feature. There are data collectors, who implement surveys, and analysts, who study substantive issues using data. There are those who use surveys to describe populations (describers) and those who test causal theories using survey data (modelers). There are the measurers who try to build empirical estimates of survey error and the reducers who try to eliminate survey error. The survey methodology literature is filled with articles by representatives of these groups, which concentrate on their favored use of surveys or their "error of choice" and who ignore the concerns of the others. They rarely confront one another, because they can retreat to their individual disci-ROBERT M. GROVES iS a Senior Study},

  abstract = {The problem of how to make the transition to a more environmentally and socially sustainable society poses questions about how such far-reaching social change can be brought about. In recent years, lifecourse transitions have been identified by a range of researchers as opportunities for policy and other actors to intervene to change how individuals use energy, taking advantage of such disruptive transitions to encourage individuals to be reflexive toward their lifestyles and how they use the technological infrastructures on which they rely. Such identifications, however, employ narratives of voluntary change that take an overly optimistic view of how individuals experience lifecourse transitions and ignore effects of experiences of unresolved or unsuccessful transitions. Drawing on interview data from the Energy Biographies project at Cardiff University, we explore three case studies where the effects of such unresolved transitions are significant. Using the concept of liminal transition as developed by Victor Turner, we examine instances where ``progressive'' narratives of energy use reduction clash with other ``narrative genres'' used to make sense of change. Such clashes show how narratives that view lifecourse transitions as opportunities ignore the challenges that such transitions may pose to efforts to construct or sustain identities.},

  abstract = {Over the past half century, government agencies in Mexico City have invested heavily in high-capacity public transit, particularly the 225-km Metro system. Nearly all of this investment has been in central locations of the metropolis. Only recently has service coverage been extended into the periphery, which has accounted for the majority of postwar metropolitan population growth. The Metro0s Line B, which opened in phases in 1999 and 2000, significantly expanded Metro coverage into the densely populated and fast-growing suburban municipality of Ecatepec. Comparing travel behavior and land use measures at six geographic scales, including the investment0s immediate catchment area, across two time periods{\textemdash}six years before and seven years after the investment opened{\textemdash}this paper investigates the effects of one of the first and only suburban high-capacity transit investments in Mexico City. While the investment sparked a significant increase in local Metro use, most of this increase came from people relying on informal transit, rather than cars. This shift reduced average transit expenditures and travel times for local residents. However, it also increased government subsidies for the Metro and had no apparent effect on road speeds. In terms of land use, the investment increased density around the stations but appears to have had little to no effect on downtown commercial development, where it might have been expected to have a significant influence. In short, the effects of Line B demonstrate much of the promise and problem with expanding high capacity transit service into the suburbs. Ridership is likely to be high, but so too will be the costs and subsidies, while the effects on car ownership and urban form are likely to be modest.},

Yet, development and urban expansion have unfolded in unexpected ways, complicating the socioeconomic and ecological integrity of peri-urban and rural spaces. This paper explores the ways in which urban expansion and state development within rural peripheries reshape political economies and, in so doing, the nature of vulnerability and precarity. Using ethnographic data collected among agrarian households in Samut Prakan province and among domestic migrant laborers in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR), the research considers the socioeconomic and ecological effects of peripheral areas' tighter integration into expanding urban geographies. In effect, to what degree does urban development unfolding in the BMR improve people's lives and, simultaneously, rework the dynamics of vulnerability and precarity experienced among those laboring in marginal spaces of the economy? A broad array of ethnographic and Landsat data demonstrates that families and individuals must renegotiate livelihood strategies to mitigate the sociopolitical, economic, and environmental outcomes of development. The findings demonstrate how agrarian families manage the structural and stochastic shocks and pressures of development in urbanizing landscapes and what this means for the future of smallholders situated within changing national economies.},

Green infrastructure enhancements have been widely supported as a means to address the resulting heat-related risks, with the challenge of realising enhancements in densely built cities necessitating the consideration of vegetated architectural features. Early efforts promoted horizontal greening, although in recent years `vertical greening' has gained increased prominence. This paper examines the hypothesis that the wider implementation of the latter typology could serve to enhance urban climate resilience, and does so by applying an analysis pathway including the coupling of a novel onedimensional vertical greening model (VGM) with an urban climate simulation framework to estimate the microclimate and energy-use implications of neighbourhood-scale vertical greening. The simulation results highlighted immediate thermal relief to canyon pedestrians, as well as net annual space-conditioning energy savings for the canyon buildings. These benefits, however, were modest, with a relatively pronounced influence offered for the urban neighbourhood than suburban, and with the living wall category than green facade application. Although the annual savings present potential for the wider implementation in temperate climates, the influence is insufficient to offer it as an exclusive solution, with any widescale application also requiring assessment against other ecosystem benefits and maintenance costs.},

In this chapter, we review the literature on the causes and effects of this type of regulation. We begin with a discussion of how researchers measure regulation empirically, which highlights the variety of methods that are used to constrain development. Many theories have been developed to explain why regulation arises, including the role of homeowners in the local political process, the influence of historical density, and the fiscal and exclusionary motives for zoning. As for the effects of regulation, most studies have found substantial effects on the housing market. In particular, regulation appears to raise house prices, reduce construction, reduce the elasticity of housing supply, and alter urban form. Other research has found that regulation influences local labor markets and household sorting across communities. Finally, we discuss the welfare implications of regulation. Although some specific rules clearly mitigate negative externalities, the benefits of more general forms of regulation are very difficult to quantify. On balance, a few recent studies suggest that the overall efficiency losses from binding constraints on residential development could be quite large.},

  abstract = {Greening and green regeneration have been developed as a major strategy for improving quality of life in cities and neighbourhoods. Greening policies and projects are being applied at both the citywide and the neigh\- bourhood level for various reasons, such as adaptation to climate change and the improvement of housing and living conditions as well as wellbeing and health. Urban policies, plans, and programmes have increasingly employed greening strategies to make urban neighbourhoods more attractive, to improve quality of life, and to provide residents with recreational space. At the same time, greening is increasingly ``exploited'' by marketoriented regeneration and construction strategies. The new critical debates on eco-gentrification{\textemdash}or distribu\- tional, procedural, and interactional injustices{\textemdash}are discussing emerging conflicts or trade-offs between green regeneration and the social or housing market impacts, as well as analysing the role of greening and green regeneration with respect to the (re)production of socio-spatial inequalities and injustices.},

The chapter reviews research on real estate brokers as intermediaries as well, focusing on the role of brokers in the matching and bargaining process, the nature of competition and entry in the brokerage industry, and the incentive issues that are present. The chapter also considers the inefficiencies that pervade the brokerage industry and the related policy debates. These are important issues both because of the inherent importance of housing and brokerage and because of the importance of housing to macroeconomic dynamics.},

This paper focuses on service-led growth as an innovative business model in the circular economy and offers the `product as service model'. A business model needs to be flexibly adjustable for changes in the market in response to changes in technology, the economy, and the environment. For firms facing increasing scarcity of resources, the right business model for using resources is becoming crucial for their growth. In a circular economy, a new method of business modelling is essential. This paper introduces the `product as a service model' using a conceptualized and case study methodology. We illustrate this innovative circular business model through product servitization at the Hyundai Automotive Enterprise in Korea. This business model can be effective because of emerging new `smart connected products' such as the `internet of things' and `fifth generation' network technologies. Cost, convenience, and the circular economy for firms, consumers, and the environment are critical factors in this new business model.},

We begin by incorporating within and cross-industry spillovers into a dynamic spatial equilibrium model in order to obtain a panel data estimating equation. This gives us a framework for measuring a rich set of agglomeration forces while controlling for a variety of potentially confounding effects. We apply this estimation strategy to detailed new data describing the industry composition of 31 English cities from 1851 to 1911. Our results show that industries grew more rapidly in cities where they had more local suppliers or other occupationally-similar industries. We find no evidence of dynamic within-industry effects, i.e., industries generally did not grow more rapidly in cities in which they were already large. Once we control for these agglomeration forces, we find evidence of strong dynamic congestion forces related to city size. We also show how to construct estimates of the combined strength of the many agglomeration forces in our model. These results suggest a lower bound estimate of the strength of agglomeration forces equivalent to a city-size divergence rate of 1.6{\textendash}2.3\% per decade.},

The symposium challenges a restricted historical focus in much of the emerging geographical literature on urban policy mobilities by drawing on a rich tradition within planning history of exploring and documenting the trans-urban travel of planning ideas and models over the last 150 years. It is argued that this longer-term perspective is required to highlight important historical continuities and institutional legacies to contemporary urban policy circuits and pathways and to question what is particularly new, distinct and innovative about an intensification in the travel of urban ideas, plans and policies over the past decade - and the accompanying scholarly interest in them. The symposium also uses the emphasis on particular details and specific experiences within planning histories to foreground and develop approaches, particularly from recent geographical scholarship, that investigate the contingent and embodied practices and wider epistemic contexts that enable - or hinder - contemporary policy transfer. {\textcopyright} 2013 Urban Research Publications Limited.},

Reports, white papers, academic articles, and guidance are produced in rapid succession, and the world's first standard on circular economy for organisations has been realised. Most of this body of knowledge has a broad focus, but sectors and products differ, and if circularity is to materialise, a more tailored understanding and approach is necessary. This paper focuses on the built environment, where its constituting elements (buildings and infrastructure) are characterised by long lifespans, numerous stakeholders, and hundreds of components and ancillary materials that interact dynamically in space and time. To facilitate the pathway towards circularity, we have attempted to identify the barriers to and enablers for the circular economy within the built environment. This will form the basis of future work to build consensus on the future development of the circular economy. Technological and regulatory developments alone will not suffice, and a shift is required in business models and stakeholders' behaviours and attitudes.},

Many believe that it offers a new approach to the problem of climate change, can contribute significantly to the goal of reducing emissions, and may hold lessons for how to govern other cross-border issues. As a result, it has been the focus of considerable debate among scholars and policy makers. But how precisely does Paris seek to govern global warming and is it likely to work in practice? We address this question by contrasting the Paris `model' of climate governance with earlier ones associated with the Kyoto Protocol and Copenhagen Accord. These models have taken different approaches to the problem of governing climate change, each with attendant advantages and limitations. The Paris model advances upon earlier efforts in certain respects, but also blends elements from earlier models. We then lay out the central axes of the debate that has emerged about the future of the Paris model, and discuss research illuminating how it may operate in practice. The agreement's success will depend on how the agreement is implemented, and on how the UNFCCC process interacts with the complementary approaches to climate governance appearing beyond it.},

  abstract = {This paper starts with a " primer" on what we know about the conceptual and empirical links between development and urbanization. While historical experience of developed countries is reviewed, today's rapid urbanization in developing countries offers an intense set of challenges. Rapid urbanization requires massive population movements and enormous local and inter-city infrastructure investments in a modern context of heavy government interventions in economies. This context raises under-researched issues, discussed in the second part of the paper. First concerns the spatial form of development. How much development should be focused in mega-cities, or huge urban clusters, as opposed to being more spatially dispersed, a critical question facing China and India today? How do we conceptualize and measure both the benefits and costs of increased urban concentration; and how are they linked to a country's evolving national industrial composition? Second, what is the evolution of spatial income inequality under massive rural-urban migration? Is inequality heightened today relative to the past by national government policies which " favor" certain cities and regions and by local government policies in those cities that may try to deflect migrants by offering them poor living conditions? {\textcopyright} 2009, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

One driver of inefficient land uses is construction decisions for highly durable buildings made under weak institutions. In a novel approach, we model the dynamics of urban land use with both formal and slum dwellings and ongoing urban redevelopment to higher building heights in the formal sector as a city grows. We analyze the evolution of Nairobi using a unique high-spatial resolution data set. The analysis suggests insufficient building volume through most of the city and large slum areas with low housing volumes near the center, where corrupted institutions deter conversion to formal sector usage.},

  abstract = {Turing tersely mentioned a notion of "cultural search" while otherwise deeply engaged in the design and operations of one of the earliest computers.1 His idea situated the individual squarely within a collaborative intellectual environment, but did he mean to suggest this in the form of a general information system? In the same writing Turing forecast mechanizations of proofs and outlined genetical searches, much later implemented in cellular automata. The conjecture explores the networked data-information-knowledge continuum as the subject of Turing's notions of search and intelligence, using analogous models from library systems theory. Floridi's philosophy of information is posed as a potential guide to applied information services design of the Turing type. The initial problem is to identify a minimal set of assumptions from Turing's essay beyond the general context of computing. This set will form a bridge to an analogous set of principles in library systems models by eliciting supporting evidence in the literature relating the two. Finally it will be shown how Floridi's philosophy of information more fully encompasses Turing's insight in view of the conjecture.},

  abstract = {This study explores the combined application of remote sensing, spatial metrics and spatial modeling to the analysis and modeling of urban growth in Santa Barbara, California. The investigation is based on a 72-year time series data set compiled from interpreted historical aerial photography and from IKONOS satellite imagery. Spatial metrics were used both specifically to assess the impact of urban development in four administrative districts, and generally to analyze the spatial and temporal dynamics of urban growth. The metrics quantify the temporal and spatial properties of urban development, and show definitively the impacts of growth constraints imposed on expansion by topography and by local planning efforts. The SLEUTH urban growth and land use change model was calibrated using the multi-temporal data sets for the entire study region. The calibrated model allowed us to fill gaps in the discontinuous historical time series of urban spatial extent, since maps and images were available only for selected years between 1930 and 2001. The model also allowed a spatial forecast of urban growth to the year 2030. The spatial metrics provided a detailed description of the accuracy of the model's historical simulations that applied also to forecasts of future development. The results illustrate the utility of modeling in explaining the amount and spatial pattern of urban growth. Even using modeling, however, the forecasting of urban development remains problematic and could benefit from further research on spatial metrics and their incorporation into the model calibration process. The combined approach using remote sensing, spatial metrics and urban modeling is powerful, and may prove a productive new direction for the improved understanding, representation and modeling of the spatiotemporal forms due to the process of urbanization. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

We exploit three key features in this setting: (i) investment in HSR has, in some cases dramatically, reduced travel times between regions, (ii) several small towns were connected to the HSR network only for political reasons, and (iii) high-speed trains have left the transportation of goods unaffected. Combining novel information on train schedules and the opening of HSR stations with panel data on all workers in Germany, we show that a reduction in travel time by 1\% raises the number of commuters between regions by 0.25\%. This effect is mainly driven by workers changing jobs to smaller cities while keeping their place of residence in larger ones. Our findings support the notion that benefits from infrastructure investments accrue in particular to peripheral regions, which gain access to a large pool of qualified workers with a preference for urban life. We find that the introduction of high-speed trains led to a modal shift toward rail transportation in particular on medium distances between 150 and 400 km.},

In a sense which becomes apparent, these measures provide estimates of the effective number of species present, and differ only in their tendency to include or to ignore the relatively rarer species. The notion of the diversity of a community as opposed to that of a sample is examined, and is related to the asymptotic form of the species-abundance curve. A new and plausible definition of evenness is derived.},

  abstract = {Decision support systems (DSS) that are simple, spatial, flexible, non-deterministic and have a long track record of practical application in a policy environment have until recently been uncommon. There has been a rapid expansion in the development and description of both quantitative and soft system methods that can be applied to decision-making processes and many of these have application in the spatial domain. This paper examines the case for inclusion of new methods in spatial systems for multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) in the context of the history and application of ASSESS (A System for Selecting Suitable Sites). As a spatial implementation of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), ASSESS has been used extensively for MCDA in a policy environment, but has not previously been described in peer-reviewed literature. ASSESS provides an interface in the ArcInfo Grid GIS environment that accesses GIS functionality and enables simple linear addition and combination of data layers, quantised into rankings from 1 to 5 corresponding to suitable/good to unsuitable/bad, for the development of output scenarios that may be constructed from different user viewpoints. Results from assessment of catchment condition for the intensive land use zone of Australia are used to illustrate issues surrounding incorporation of new methods and spatially explicit operations into the simple ASSESS AHP MCDA process. The knowledge and methods base is outlined diagrammatically using AHP MCDA as the core process, and new methods and spatial approaches as adjuncts or inputs at various stages. New methods can assist with correlation of input data layers, subjective weightings, and mixing of qualitative and quantitative data. The merits of the inclusion of quantitative methods based on logical empiricism for explicit definition of input errors and uncertainty, approaches to quantisation of input data, and optimisation of outputs are contrasted with soft systems approaches that incorporate more linguistic and information theory into landscape analysis. The potential role for spatial analysis both in providing static input factor layers and in dynamic optimisation and seamless integration in the decision process are explored. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {There is now no doubt that current global production-consumption-disposal systems are threatening the fundamental conditions of existence on this planet. In response, the pressing need for total system transformation has gained civic and political traction, feeding into longstanding debates and interventions that are aimed at recalibrating prevailing economic and social practices. One such debate and intervention is that of the circular economy (CE). Here, advocates argue that current linear resource and energy use systems must be reconfigured into loops of re-use, repair, refurbishment, and recycling, displacing primary production and lessening greenhouse gas emissions in the process. This agenda has potentially profound implications for aspects of daily social practices. Yet, to date, little attention has been paid (politically and in research) to how the CE does and will interact with everyday habits, norms, and meanings. In response, this paper explores some of the conceptual assumptions underlying the CE `consumer'. It argues that mainstream CE debates are underscored by an impoverished view of our relationships with complex material cultures, which in turn is creating barriers to transformation. Drawing on empirical research into responses to the CE in the UK and the Netherlands, this paper contrasts the challenges of inciting consumers to take up new, resource-efficient business models in contexts of hyper-consumerism, with a more hopeful `small story' of overt, small-scale circular spaces, that nevertheless embed the CE and its underlying impetuses more clearly into the everyday.},

The aim of this article is to consider the potential value of developing connections between two currently disconnected approaches to resource use and cities-material flow analysis (MFA) and transitions analysis (TA). This article attempts to address this deficit and looks critically at resource flows through cities and the infrastructures that have been-or could be-reconfigured to more effectively manage these flows from the perspectives of MFA and TA. This is an issue that has not been addressed, with the result that inadequate attention has been paid to the reconfiguring of urban infrastructures whose construction and maintenance are, in turn, often the largest expenditures at the city government level. Insufficient attention has been given to the fact that the design, construction, and operation of infrastructures (specifically energy, waste, water, sanitation, and transport infrastructures) create a sociotechnical environment that plays an important role in shaping, and potentially reshaping, how resources are procured, used, and disposed of by the city.

  abstract = {The problems of violence in Latin America are often reiterated, yet understanding how and why violence declines is far less common. While urban violence takes different forms and has a range of motivations, we suggest that strengthening political and social institutions are important in violence reduction processes. We examine this using a comparative analysis of two cities which have recently seen unusual and marked reductions in lethal violence: Bogot{\'a} in Colombia and Recife in Brazil. Drawing on primary data collection, the case studies suggest that novel leaders who take advantage of critical junctures can deliver unexpected improvements to public security; and improvements are linked with institutionalising progressive security policies, increasing accountability of political institutions, and social reforms encouraging civic values and commitments to non-violence. While findings are specific to these two cases, they may plausibly apply to a broader range of cities, such that commitments to improve public policy and political institutions can overcome structural risk factors that foster violence.},

  abstract = {Over a millennium Europe has become largely urban. While urban growth, absolute and as a percentage of a growing population, has been as dramatic as economic change, many elements of continuity tie the present to the past. This evolution with path dependence is highlighted if one looks at European urban economies in terms of a dual systems model combining central place and network relationships. After the medieval push of town creation and differentiation, the early modern period saw a slowing of the increase in urban population and proportion, even as cities anchored the growth of overseas trade and of integrated territorial states. Growth was concentrated in major ports and capital or court cities. The role of cities in the rise of a market economy capable of sustained growth in output per head is tied to ongoing debates about how and why growth began in Europe, and within Europe in England. Industrialization led to enormous increases in urban agglomeration driven by transport improvements and increasing returns to scale in manufacturing as well as distribution. However, leadership functions tended to concentrate in giant capital cities rather than in the new industrial towns and conurbations. Within cities, rapid in-migration and lags in institutions and technology for urban management aggravated crowding and squalor. Conditions improved toward the turn of the 20th century, thanks in part to electricity and to more responsive and active government, as well as to slower urbanization. The depression and destruction of the 1914-1945 period was followed by great prosperity and enormous building. The information age appears to have conflicting impacts on agglomeration in Europe, with policy leaning toward sustaining dense cities (relative at least to the U.S.). The shift from older to newer industries, as well as growth in leisure and high human capital pursuits, has shifted activity away from many 19th century industrial centers and toward revitalized older cities and urbanized regions with higher amenity levels. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas traditional approaches rely on assumed statistical correlation, TAPAS relies on causality, i.e., the focus is on the decisions and negotiations that lead to activities. TAPAS is composed of two connected layers, one that simulates the physical activities, e.g., production and transportation, and one that simulates the decision making and interaction between actors. We illustrate TAPAS with a scenario in which the consequences of three transport policy and infrastructure measures are studied. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

There still seem to be some confusion regarding some key relationships, one of them being the effect of income on public transport demand. The purpose of this article is therefore to provide empirical estimates of how different factors, including price and car ownership (although income being the main issue), affect the demand for local public transport. Methods: In order to achieve the aim of the study, an econometric FD-model, allowing for unobserved effects, was estimated using panel data from Swedish counes from 1986 to 2001. Results: The short-run (direct) elascies with respect to fare, vehicle-kilometres, income and car ownership were found to be -0,4, 0,55, 0,34, and -1,37 respectively. However, income affects public transport demand directly, and through its effect on car ownership, these effects works in opposite direction. Combining these it is found that total income effect is close to zero. Conclusions: It is concluded that, although the findings of several previous studies suggests that demand for public transport might be falling with increased income, there is no evidence of such effects even when the full effect of changes in income (including changes in car ownership) is taken into account. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

The analysis shows how the efficiency of the individual counties has changed over time. The results are used to provide a ranking (in terms of efficiency) of the Swedish public transport authorities that can provide a basis for benchmarking. It is concluded that the efficiency of the public transport providers in all counties fell during the observed time period. Defining cost efficiency as the ratio of minimum cost to observed cost, the overall (average) cost efficiency for the industry fell from 85.7\% in the eighties to 60.4\% for the period from 2000 to 2009. Possible explanations for the development include increased emphasis on route density as well as higher environmental and safety requirements. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

So far, public transport appears to be on the losing side in terms of market shares. The aim if this paper is to investigate if a different policy could result in higher public transport usage and improved social welfare. In order to achieve this, a model, explaining public transport usage, public transport supply and costs, is estimated. The model is then used in order to simulate the outcome of an alternative policy of social welfare maximization. It is found that the current policy of the Swedish transport is not efficient in terms of maximizing welfare. In 2011, public transport fares should have been lower in 20 of 21 counties and the supply of vehicle kilometres should have been higher in 17 of 21 counties. Implementing a welfare maximizing policy would have increased the number of trips per capita by 17.2\% in 2011 and by an average of 6.7\% for the period 1986-2011.},

Most commonly this is done using data envelopment analysis (DEA) or Stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to determine the level of (in)efficiency of different decision-making units. These methods have also been applied to public transport. However, in this context their application presents some problems, including how to define what is produced and how that should be measured. Several options have been suggested including vehicle-kilometres, number of trips, number of passenger-kilometres, and scores in passenger satisfaction surveys. The primary aim of this paper is to discuss how production of public transport should be defined and measured in efficiency studies. It is argued that output should be measured by number of trips and vehicle-kilometres as these together represent consumers' willingness to pay for public transport services. A proposed model for evaluating the efficiency of public transport operations is presented and estimated. This model is evaluated by comparing its results to those obtained from competing models estimated using the same data from 27 Swedish counties from 1986 to 2015. The data are used to estimate stochastic cost frontier models and it is concluded that the models using only vehicle-kilometres or only passenger trips tend to underestimate efficiency compared to a model using both at the same time. It is also concluded that smaller models (using only a single output measure) result in different rankings of the decision-making units.},

The problem is intended to determine a supply chain configuration of manufacturing plants, distributors, and retailers in the distribution network. The problem is formulated as an integer-programming model. The mathematical model incorporates unit transportation costs between entities and two types of fixed costs, including fixed cost for transportation routes and fixed cost for opening facilities. The objective of the model is to minimise the total costs of supply chain operation incurred in allocating the retailers to a distribution centre and the distribution centres to a manufacturing plant. An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)-based heuristic is developed for solving the model. The heuristic is tested on various problem sizes generated. All the problem instances are solved using solver LINGO to evaluate the robustness of the ACO-based algorithm. The ACO-based heuristic emerges as a computationally efficient algorithm. Solutions can be obtained using the ACO-based heuristic within a reasonable computational time with a gap of about 10\% on average from the optimal solutions.},

We examined 120 planning documents from 19 U.S. cities to identify if and how the stated benefits that cities use within their rationales for green infrastructure programs (rationale statements) align with the criteria used to site green infrastructure at the neighborhood scale (siting statements). Our findings suggest that many of the desired benefits stated in the rationales for green infrastructure lack corresponding and specific siting criteria. This was particularly evident for rationale statements concerning social and cultural ecosystem services, seemingly because certain benefits, especially those related to stormwater management, are prioritized over other green infrastructure services. While multiple benefits remain a dominant rationale for green infrastructure in the cities analyzed, including stormwater management, social cohesion, and biodiversity benefits, siting criteria were dominated by stormwater management, available locations, and other logistical considerations. These findings indicate a large-scale misalignment between the multifunctional ideal of urban green infrastructure and the procedures used to implement green infrastructure programs. We conclude with a discussion of how siting criteria and processes can be elaborated to deliver the desired benefits of green infrastructure.},

This essay traces the impact of Tiebout's work and subsequent scholarship in public choice, identifying important lessons and lingering issues. Although public choice has demonstrated that polycentric systems are adept and flexible in producing and providing municipal services and a variety of interlocal agreements, the presence of municipal boundaries gives rise to a host of spillover problems, such as urban sprawl and segregation. These spillovers are particularly nefarious because, unlike the natural cooperation that seems to occur in service provision, municipalities tend to assert narrow self-interest in the face of these types of externalities. The essay proposes that, commensurate with the growing salience of equity among the pillars of public administration, interjurisdictional spillovers and their attendant equity impacts will be the central challenge for thinkers studying metropolitan governance in the 21st century. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Society for Public Administration.},

  abstract = {In travel behavior modeling, an important topic is to investigate what drives people to travel. A systematic analysis should examine why, where and when various activities are engaged in, and how activity engagement is related to the spatial and institutional organization of an urban area. In view of this, this paper presents a stochastic model for solving the combined activity/destination/route choice problem. It is a time-dependent model for long-term transport planning such as travel demand forecasting. The activity/destination choices are based on multinomial logit formulae and, the route choice is governed by stochastic user equilibrium principle. The solution algorithm is proposed together with a numerical example for demonstration. It is shown that the proposed modeling approach provides a powerful tool for fully understanding and predicting the complex travel behavior at strategic level. {\textcopyright} 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the Feeder Vehicle Routing Problem (FVRP), a new variant of the vehicle routing problem (VRP), in which each customer is served by either a large (truck) or a small vehicle (motorcycle). In this particular type of delivery, the trucks and the motorcycles must depart from the depot, visit the customers, and eventually return to the depot. During the delivery process, the motorcycles travel to the truck locations for reloading. The ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is employed for solving the problem with the objective of determining the number of dispatching sub-fleets and optimal routes to minimize the total cost (fixed route and travel costs). Three benchmark datasets are generated to examine the performance of the FVPR. For comparison purposes, all instances are executed by dispatching only trucks as in the traditional VRP and a four-stage hierarchical heuristic. Additionally, ACO is compared to optimal solutions for small instances. The results indicate that the proposed ACO algorithm yields promising solutions particularly for large instances within a reasonable time frame in an efficient manner.},

Using the runners ex-ante predictions of their own marathon finish times, we show that men consistently overestimate their abilities relative to women. Further, we find that men slow more than women in the later stages of the race and find that less even pacing is correlated with worse marathon performance, results in-line with previous studies.

Regional disparities are also unlikely to diminish through migration, wage flexibility and capital mobility. Migration is lower in most transition economies than in the EU and capital mobility tends to reinforce existing regional disparities. Only wage flexibility is higher than in most European labour markets.},

Using existing data collected from informal dwellings in South Africa, the findings from a digital simulation study reveal that cool roof paints can currently lower excessive heat stress conditions by 42{\textendash}63\% when applied to high thermal mass dwellings with poorly insulated lightweight corrugated sheeting roofing. However, for the future 2100 climate scenarios this strategy only lowers excessive heat stress conditions by 12{\textendash}17\%.

In Los Angeles (LA), increasing trends in extreme heat are expected to intensify and exacerbate the urban heat island effect, leading to greater health risks for vulnerable populations. Partnerships between city policymakers and scientists are becoming more important as the need to provide data-driven recommendations for sustainability and mitigation efforts becomes critical. Here we present a model to produce heat vulnerability index (HVI) maps driven by surface temperature data from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) new Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) thermal infrared sensor. ECOSTRESS was launched in June 2018 with the capability to image fine-scale urban temperatures at a 70 m resolution throughout different times of the day and night. The HVI model further includes information on socio-demographic data, green vegetation abundance, and historical heatwave temperatures from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the Aqua spacecraft since 2002. During a period of high heat in July 2018, we identified the five most vulnerable communities at a sub-city block scale in the LA region. The persistence of high HVI throughout the day and night in these areas indicates a clear and urgent need for implementing cooling technologies and green infrastructure to curb future warming.},

In this article, we argue that the estimated effect sizes of controls are unlikely to have a causal interpretation themselves, though. This is because even valid controls are possibly endogenous and represent a combination of several different causal mechanisms operating jointly on the outcome, which is hard to interpret theoretically. Therefore, we recommend refraining from interpreting the marginal effects of controls and focusing on the main variables of interest, for which a plausible identification argument can be established. To prevent erroneous managerial or policy implications, coefficients of control variables should be clearly marked as not having a causal interpretation or omitted from regression tables altogether. Moreover, we advise against using control variable estimates for subsequent theory building and meta-analyses.},

  abstract = {The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on the 11th of March 2020, but the world is still reeling from its aftermath. Originating from China, cases quickly spread across the globe, prompting the implementation of stringent measures by world governments in efforts to isolate cases and limit the transmission rate of the virus. These measures have however shattered the core sustaining pillars of the modern world economies as global trade and cooperation succumbed to nationalist focus and competition for scarce supplies. Against this backdrop, this paper presents a critical review of the catalogue of negative and positive impacts of the pandemic and proffers perspectives on how it can be leveraged to steer towards a better, more resilient low-carbon economy. The paper diagnosed the danger of relying on pandemic-driven benefits to achieving sustainable development goals and emphasizes a need for a decisive, fundamental structural change to the dynamics of how we live. It argues for a rethink of the present global economic growth model, shaped by a linear economy system and sustained by profiteering and energy-gulping manufacturing processes, in favour of a more sustainable model recalibrated on circular economy (CE) framework. Building on evidence in support of CE as a vehicle for balancing the complex equation of accomplishing profit with minimal environmental harms, the paper outlines concrete sector-specific recommendations on CE-related solutions as a catalyst for the global economic growth and development in a resilient post-COVID-19 world.},

  abstract = {With the world population expected to swell by almost two and a half billion people by 2050, new and existing cities must accommodate many of them. Depending on the choices we make, this could exacerbate existing problems like pollution, congestion, lack of infrastructure or public services, and marginalization of the poor. Or, if we rethink urban living and its governance, it could equally be an opportunity to develop the low-carbon, resource-efficient and socially just cities called for in the New Urban Agenda. This assessment report from the International Resource Panel, explores this transition through urban planning, investment in resource efficient infrastructure technologies and entrepreneurial governance. The report suggests a fundamentally new approach to the way we design cities, so that people live in functionally and socially mixed neighbourhoods with better mobility options, including public transport, walking and cycling. They should have more energy efficient heating, cooling and lighting and more resource efficient components, such as vehicles, infrastructure, buildings and factories. All of which should be complemented by changing habits from consumers and producers of good and services, including better waste management or recycling. For example, the area of Hammarby Sj{\"o}stad in Stockholm, Sweden, has been transformed from an industrial brownfield into a desirable place to live. The redevelopment created a compact area of medium-sized city blocks, small enough to walk around, with a network of green spaces, quays and walkways running through it. During development, a great deal of thought went into how people could move around their community. The use of sustainable transport is encouraged through an education centre, which provides information and promotes environmentally friendly choices and actions.},

Accordingly, this article introduces a conceptual framework in which a metric notion of justice can be employed in different spatial contexts, drawing upon the theoretical conceptualization of Amartya Sen's `capabilities' and Pierre Bourdieu's `field', capital forms and `habitus'. The main hypothesis assumes that capital resources, which are formed in an individual's living environment, determine their life chances, thus influencing spatial equality of opportunity (i.e. social justice).},

We combine data on geo-coded riots with data on state elections and on demographics and public goods provision to construct a unique panel data set for 16 large states in India from 1981 to 2001. A new instrument is used that draws upon the random variation in the day of the week that Hindu festivals fall on, as set by a lunar calendar. The probability of a riot increases if a Hindu festival falls on a Friday, the holy day for Muslims. This allows us to isolate the causal effect of riots on electoral results. The results are also corrected for under-reporting of riots and their effect on nearby districts. We find that riots occurring in the year preceding an election increase the vote share of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party by at least 5 percentage points.},

Data from 232 districts of India that have at least one city or town with a population {$>$}0.1 million will be used. The analysis shows the positive impact of the district's population size and economy on the proportion of trips longer than 5 km. In addition, there is a positive impact from the overall population density and a negative impact from urban density on the share of long-distance trips. This study shows that as districts in India continue to urbanize and develop economically, the propensity for traveling long distances will probably increase. This will result in an increased dependency on motorized modes of transport that negatively impacts the environment, resource consumption, and human health. This study identifies the need for the adoption of development control regulations and policies to maintain the proportion of long-distance trips at a low level as India continues to urbanize. The findings of this study could be useful to project externalities of the transport sector in future years when the urbanization pattern is considered.  2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

In Stata such plots can be produced by the marginsplot command ([R] marginsplot). However, while marginsplot is very versatile and flexible, it has two major limitations: it can only process results left behind by margins ([R] margins)and itcanonly handle one setof results atthe time. Inthisarticle Iintroduce a new command called coefplot that overcomes these limitations. It plots results from any estimation command and combines results from several models into a single graph. The default behavior of coefplot is to plot markers for coefficients and horizontal spikes for confidence intervals. However, coefplot can also produce various other types of graphs. The capabilities of coefplot are illustrated in this article using a series of examples. Keywords: coefplot, marginsplot, margins,regression plot,coefficientsplot Contents},

To explain urbanization, standard models emphasize rural{\textendash}urban migration, focusing on rural push factors (agricultural modernization and rural poverty) and urban pull factors (industrialization and urban-biased policies). Using new historical data on urban birth and death rates for 7 countries from Industrial Europe (1800{\textendash}1910) and 35 developing countries (1960{\textendash}2010), we argue that a non-negligible part of developing countries' rapid urban growth and urbanization may also be linked to demographic factors, i.e. rapid internal urban population growth, or an urban push. High urban natural increase in today's developing countries follows from lower urban mortality, relative to Industrial Europe, where higher urban deaths offset urban births. This compounds the effects of migration and displays strong associations with urban congestion, providing additional insight into the phenomenon of urbanization without growth.},

These conclusions are based on a statistical analysis of key variables derived from a revealed preference conception of QOL. This is an important methodological advance, since relevant variables for directly constructing hedonic measures of QOL normally are unavailable for central cities. The basic Census data used in the analysis also indicate that the observed "turnaround" is evident without respect to size of metro area within the set of 25 largest and without respect to region of the country.},

It noted that for the fi rst time in history, more than half the world's population resides in urban areas. The same year UN-HABITAT issued a report highlighting the slums and deplorable living con-ditions in cities in developing countries. That report (UN-HABITAT 2007) estimated that by the end of 2007 there would be more than 1 billion slum dwellers, most of them living in developing countries. It claims that in many cases the economic circumstances of urban migrants are worse than those of rural peasants. In 2003 the United Nations surveyed member govern-ments eliciting their attitudes toward urbanization. It found that the " vast majority " of these governments would have liked to shift populations back to rural areas and to stem the tide of urbanization. Is urbanization actually bad for development? If life in urban areas were worse for urban dwellers than the life they left behind, presumably they would leave the city. So why all the fuss about urbanization and development? This article considers the evidence on the mechanisms increasing eco-nomic effi ciency in cities and examines the record of cities in facilitating economic output and in improving the consumption opportunities avail-able to urban residents. Much of this evidence is based on observations from highly developed countries, but a growing body of evidence is based on analyses of developing countries. The evidence clearly supports the con-clusion that cities are important facilitators of economic growth, increased productivity, and rising incomes in poor and rich nations alike. Policies to facilitate, not inhibit, urbanization are likely to improve economic condi-tions in developing countries. The analysis suggests a variety of broad polices that would improve resource allocation and increase incomes in such countries.},

  abstract = {The 21st century has been called the `age of the city'. The concentration of human activity is what makes cities such an important space of opportunity and challenge. This article views urban development challenges from an education perspective and argues that education must be viewed as an important intermediary for capitalising on the physical, intellectual and social capital available in cities. The distribution of educational opportunity within cities must be monitored to ensure that education plays a role in reducing and not exacerbating urban inequalities. Making sure that the city works for all requires improving how we plan cities and making urban planning processes more inclusive through knowledge-based participation. There needs to be more appreciation of education's role in transformative urban development and stronger advocacy by education stakeholders to gain a seat in the circles that wield the most power in the urban futures debates.},

In this survey, we focus on the role of both exogenous attributes such as climate and coastal access and endogenous attributes such as local air pollution and green space. A city's greenness is a function of its natural beauty and is an emergent property of the types of households and firms that locate within its borders and the types of local and national regulations enacted by voters.We explore four main issues related to sustainability and environmental quality in cities. First, we introduce a household locational choice model to highlight the role that environmental amenities play in shaping where households locate within a city. We then analyze how ongoing suburbanization affects the carbon footprint of cities. Third, we explore how the system of cities is affected by urban environmental amenity dynamics and we explore the causes of these dynamics. Fourth, we review the recent literature on the private costs and benefits of investing in "green" buildings. Throughout this survey, we pay careful attention to empirical research approaches and highlight what are open research questions. While much of the literature focuses on cities in the developed world, we anticipate that similar issues will be of increased interest in developing nation's cities.},

  abstract = {The study of civil war ranks among the most notable developments in political science during the last decade. Several important papers have been published in this period and the field has witnessed an important shift toward cross-national, large-N econometric studies (e.g. Collier and Hoeffler 2004; Fearon and Laitin 2003), following a previous shift from the case-study format to that of theoretically informed studies (Wickham-Crowley 1992; Skocpol 1979; Scott 1976; Eckstein 1965). However, despite these advances much remains to be understood. On the one hand, the conceptual foundations of our understanding of civil wars are still weak (Kalyvas 2001; 2003; Cramer 2002); on the other hand, econometric studies have produced very little in terms of robust results - the main one being that, like autocratic regimes (Przeworski et al. 2000), civil wars are more likely to occur in poor countries. The problems of econometric studies are well known: their main findings are incredibly sensitive to coding and measurement procedures (Hegre and Sambanis 2006; Montalvo and Reynal-Querol 2005; Sambanis 2004b); they entail a considerable distance between theoretical constructs and proxies (Cederman and Girardin 2007; Fearon et al. 2007) as well as multiple observationally equivalent pathways (Kalyvas 2007; Humphreys 2005; Kocher 2004; Sambanis 2004a); they suffer from endogeneity (Miguel et al. 2004); they lack clear microfoundations or are based on erroneous ones (Cramer 2007; Kalyvas and Kocher 2007b; Guti{\'e}rrez San{\'i}n 2004); and, finally, they are subject to narrow (and untheorized) scope conditions (Wimmer and Min 2006).},

Cities not only contribute to global climate change by emitting the majority of anthropogenic greenhouse gases but also are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and extreme weather. We explore options for establishing sustainable energy systems by reducing energy consumption, particularly in the buildings and transportation sectors, and providing robust, decentralized, and renewable energy sources. Through technical advancements in power density, city-integrated renewable energy will be better suited to satisfy the high-energy demands of growing urban areas. Several economic, technical, behavioral, and political challenges need to be overcome for innovation to improve urban sustainability.},

  abstract = {This paper offers an interpretive framework linking polycentric urban expansion in emerging/frontier economies to the global extension of infrastructure networks. Drawing from scholarship on state restructuring, we theorize an infrastructure scramble whereby numerous state actors and agencies make massive investments in infrastructure connectivity to secure effective integration to transnational value chains as economic and geopolitical competition intensify. This has manifold territorial implications, and matters for debates on planetary urbanization. Novel urbanization processes include the proliferation of peri-urban nodes. Built in cheaply available land, these respond to (or anticipate economic gains from) enhanced connective infrastructure. In contrast to city-regional exemplars, project-led polycentrism does not arise from territorially decentralized governance arrangements, and may deepen peri-urban exclusion. The paper includes an experimental comparison of two peri-urban nodal projects: the Iranduba University City (IUC), located in a riparian rainforest of the Brazilian Amazon 17 miles from bustling Manaus, and the Bagamoyo Port and Special Economic Zone, located 35 miles north of the congested port of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's expansive capital. Our findings suggest that: (i) techno-entrepreneurial capacity requirements underpin the centralist scalar politics governing the development of peri-urban nodes; as (ii) state-led projects rely on ambitious physical planning, with masterplans evincing elite, globalization-oriented objectives that neglect local needs and trigger displacement and (iii) even failing projects spearhead varying trajectories of territorial transformation in erstwhile-stagnant peri-urban peripheries. Concluding, we call for further research on multiple drivers and modalities of polycentrism in the global South, and the infrastructure scramble's broad implications for hyper-connected and bypassed territories.},

  abstract = {Standard models of labor migration suggest that migration is induced by real income differentials across locations and will, ceteris paribus, serve to reduce those differentials. And yet there is evidence that growing spatial inequality may co-exist with increased migration from poorer to richer areas, at least over certain ranges. At a theoretical level, this raises the question of modeling opposing forces, for convergence and divergence, in a common framework, and identifying the precise conditions under which the tendency for convergence dominates, or is dominated by, the forces for divergence. A conventional route to introducing forces for divergence is to bring agglomeration effects into the standard setup. This paper explores an alternative route, based on a theoretical and empirical proposition of the migration literature, namely, that migration is a selective process. Focusing on skilled migration, the paper demonstrates the different forces in play that make selective migration a force for both divergence and convergence, and characterizes where each set of forces dominates. Finally, it explores the consequences for convergence of combining migration selectivity and agglomeration effects arising from migrant networks. {\textcopyright} Oxford University Press 2005; all rights reserved.},

While the contribution of rural-urban inequality is much higher than that of inland-coastal inequality in terms of levels, the trend is very different. The rural-urban contribution has not changed very much over time, but the inland-coastal contribution has increased several folds. The paper ends by investigating the role of labor migration in this outcome.},

  abstract = {The basic story of global inequality in the last three decades has been an overall decline, but one which is composed of quite intricate patterns. There has been a decline in between-country inequality as China and India have grown relative to the US and other rich countries. This has been accompanied by an increase in within-country inequality, but this is itself composed of rising inequality in some countries such as China, India, and the US, and declining inequality in other countries, including large economies in Latin America. Section II of the paper reviews these patterns, highlighting country diversity to make the central point that policy matters. Section III addresses a normative question - what relative weight should be given to within-country and between-country inequality in making an overall global assessment? This section brings on board recent philosophical discourse, including on inequality of opportunity in a global frame. Section IV returns to the 'policy matters' theme and takes up global constraints on national redistribution policy in a globalized world: for example, a race to the bottom on taxation to attract and keep capital and talent, and possible global institutional responses to alleviate these constraints.},

Among theories that invoke computation, we make a further distinction between computable and computational or machine learning theories. We argue that the modern machine learning algorithms, although impressive in terms of their performance, do not necessarily shed enough light on human learning. Instead, they seem to take us further away from Simon's lifelong quest to understand the mechanics of actual human behaviour.},

  abstract = {Environmental justice (EJ) addresses the unequal distribution of environmental goods and harms and promotes people's right to be involved in environmental decision-making. In recent years, EJ considerations have expanded to the use of Nature-based solutions (NbS) in urban areas, mainly how their planning and imple\- mentation can impact human well-being and social justice. However, what constitutes a just solution and how the concept is treated in the literature can take many forms. This study reviews how EJ is conceptualised and analysed in urban NbS research and documents the potential outcomes of diverse interventions. We developed a conceptual framework for the review process, focusing on the EJ definitions transferable to NbS research. We then conducted a systematic review of 152 articles published between 2000 and 2021. Selected articles addressed urban NbS from the recognitional, procedural and distributional interpretations of justice. Publication trends, methods, and demographic variables were recorded for each article. Furthermore, we focused on the means for assessing EJ in empirical terms, such as the framing of justice-related challenges, assessment in\- dicators, and the reported justice outcomes. Findings demonstrate the dominance of research themes, the skewness towards the distributive dimension of justice, and a large variety of metrics and indicators used to assess EJ implications. Our results also show that EJ outcomes have mostly been reported to be mixed or negative. The results are used to identify research gaps and issues that need to be addressed to enhance EJ effects in urban NbS.},

I interpret these results in light of a paper by Brueckner, who used a simple urban model to suggest that location and commuting patterns by race could change as a result of the repeal of Apartheid era legislation such as the Group Areas Act that made it impossible for black South Africans to live near the centre of cities. A key finding is that monetary and time costs of commuting in South African cities are high and have increased in the post-Apartheid period. Journey times are much higher than the OECD country average and a sample of developing country cities. Part of the explanation for increasing average commute times is population growth in South African cities, which has been substantial. Both the population and number of commuters doubled between 1993 and 2013 in the six metropolitan municipalities (metros) analysed in this paper. Since commuting costs a substantial amount and generates negative externalities through congestion I also explore the financing of public transport.},

There are a number of sources of data, including household surveys, firm surveys, and administrative data, and it can be hard to keep up with all of them.

Using geocoded microdata from Swedish population registers, we remove population composition effects from the scaling relation of wage income to test how much of the previously reported superlinear scaling is truly attributable to increased social interconnectivity in cities. The Swedish data confirm the previously reported scaling relations on the aggregate level, but they provide better information on the micromechanisms responsible for them. We find that the standard interpretation of urban scaling is incomplete as social interactions only explain about half of the scaling parameter of wage income and that scaling relations substantively reflect differences in cities' sociodemographic composition. Those differences are generated by selective migration of highly productive individuals into larger cities. Big cities grow through their attraction of talent from their hinterlands and the already-privileged benefit disproportionally from urban agglomeration.},

This conceptual frame views cities as agglomerations of 'urban regions'--which exhibit significant spatial intra-urban inequalities, and where trends towards equality are constrained predominantly by labor immobility and land-use policies. One of the meta-insights of this paper is that urban problems are often made worse when they coexist and overlap in space. It shows how spatial inequalities are a structural cause of their own perpetuation, and to suggest policies that go beyond neighborhood interventions.},

Results showed that (1) SM decreased gradually from southeast to northwest in the horizontal direction, while in vertical direction, SM decreased from 0 to 90 cm and then increased from 90 to 500 cm soil depth. (2) Land use had a significant impact on the amount and profile distribution of SM. (3) The coefficients of variation and nugget ratios of SM at different depths in 0-500 cm profile demonstrated a decreasing-increasing trend, and these indices showed a good consistency in expressing the variation of SM. Understanding this information is beneficial to the management/mediation of soil and water processes, and to the restoration of eco-environment on the Loess Plateau.},

To develop tailored coastal climate services that can inform decision makers on climate adaptation in coastal cities, a better understanding and modeling of multifaceted urban dynamics is important. We develop a coastal urban model family, where the population growth and urbanization rates are modeled in the framework of diffusion over the half-bounded and bounded domains, and apply the maximum entropy principle to the latter case. Population density distributions are derived analytically whenever possible. Steady-state wave solutions balancing the width of inhabited coastal zones, with the skewed distributions maximizing population entropy, might be responsible for the coastward migrations outstripping the demographic development of the hinterland. With appropriate modifications of boundary conditions, the developed family of diffusion models can describe coastal urban dynamics affected by climate change.},

As a result, many people have concluded that a new framework for analyzing trade is needed.' The main elements of such a framework-economies of scale, the possibility of product differentiation, and imperfect competition-have been discussed by such authors as Bela Balassa, Herbert Grubel (1967,1970), and Irving Kravis, and have been "in the air" for many years. In this paper I present a simple formal analysis which incorporates these elements, and show how it can be used to shed some light on some issues which cannot be handled in more conventional models. These include, in particular, the causes of trade between economies with similar factor endowments, and the role of a large domestic market in encouraging exports. The basic model of this paper is one in which there are economies of scale in production and firms can costlessly differentiate their products. In this model, which is derived from recent work by Avinash Dixit and Joseph Stiglitz, equilibrium takes the form of Chamberlinian monopolistic competition: each firm has some monopoly power, but entry drives monopoly profits to zero. When two imperfectly competitive economies of this kind are allowed to trade, increasing returns produce trade and gains from trade even if the economies have identical tastes, technology, and factor endowments. This basic model of trade is presented in Section I. It is closely related to a model I have developed elsewhere; in this paper a somewhat more restrictive formulation of demand is used to make the analysis in later sections easier. The rest of the paper is concerned with two extensions of the basic model. In Section II, I examine the effect of transportation costs, and show that countries with larger domestic markets will, other things equal, have higher wage rates. Section III then deals with "home market" effects on trade patterns. It provides a formal justification for the commonly made argument that countries will tend to export those goods for which they have relatively large domestic markets. This paper makes no pretense of generality. The models presented rely on extremely restrictive assumptions about cost and utility. Nonetheless, it is to be hoped that the paper provides some useful insights into those aspects of international trade which simply cannot be treated in our usual models. I. The Basic Model A. Assumptions of the Model There are assumed to be a large number of potential goods, all of which enter symmetrically into demand. Specifically, we assume that all individuals in the economy have the same utility function, (1) U= Cis 0{$<$}0{$<$} I where ci is consumption of the ith good.

This simple regularity is puzzling; even more puzzling is the fact that it has apparently remained true for at least the past century. Standard models of urban systems offer no explanation of the power law. A random growth model proposed by Herbert Simon 40 years ago is the best try to date - but while it can explain a power law, it cannot reproduce one with the right exponent. At this point we are in the frustrating postion of having a striking empirical regularity with no good theory to account for it. J. Japan. Int. Econ., December 1996, 10(4), pp. 399-418.

  abstract = {As the example of Silicon Valley makes clear, the economic analysis of location--the geography of the economy--is the subfield of economics to which the typical buzzwords of complexity apply most obviously and dramatically. The spatial economy is, self-evidently, a self-organizing system characterized by path dependence; it is a domain in which the interaction of individual decisions produces unexpected emergent behavior at the aggregate level; its dynamic landscapes are typically rugged, and the evolution of the spatial economy typically involves "punctuated equilibria," in which gradual change in the driving variables leads to occasional discontinuous change in the resulting behavior. And in economic geography, as in many physical sciences, there are puzzling empirical regularities--like the startlingly simple law that describes city sizes--which seem to imply higher level principles at work. There is a long intellectual tradition in economic geography (or rather several separate but convergent traditions). The last few years have, however, seen a considerable acceleration of work, especially in the development of theoretical models of the emergence of spatial structure. This paper is a brief but I hope suggestive survey of this work, intended to convey a flavor of the exciting ideas being developed without going into technical detail. The paper is in five parts. I begin with two very simple motivating models that illustrate why economic geography so naturally leads to the typical "complexity" themes. Each of the next three parts then describes a particular major line of research. A final part discusses implications and directions for future work.},

This paper develops a simple model which illustrates this argument. Two main results are developed. First, the nature of trade depends on how similar countries are in their factor endowments. As countries become more similar, the trade between them will increasingly become intraindustry in character. Second, the effects of opening trade depend on its type. If intraindustry trade is sufficiently dominant, the advantages of extending the market will outweigh the distributional effects, and the owners of scarce as well as of abundant factors will be better off.},

This phenomenon demands a better understanding and measurement of the situation of the youth labor market holistically. The aim of this paper is to propose a new youth labor market index tailored to developing countries, which we name the Youth Labor Index for Low Income Countries (YLILI). The index combines 12 indicators into three dimensions: transition (quantity adjustments in the labor market), working conditions and education. The index suggests that the strength of the youth labor market is the highest in (low-income) Europe and Central Asia and lowest in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Working conditions and education remain important issues in all of sub-Saharan Africa, while the picture is more mixed for South Asia. Transition scores are high in developing countries, suggesting that many workers are unable to withstand extended periods of inactivity. Finally, the index highlights the urgent need to address the scarcity of data on the youth demographic.},

However, the quick calcula- tions attempted by scholars claiming to correct this flaw and to establish an absence of size-growth relationship, does not seem to be free from methodological or other errors. The present paper obtains the growth rates for different size class of towns taking the towns that belonged to each class in the base year The growth rate of class I towns works out as consistently higher than those of lower categories. It is further shown that the percentage of towns registering more than sixty per cent decadal growth is much higher in the case of the top category. The disparity in the growth rate is also low for towns of this category, which has further gone down in the seventies suggesting strengthening of their economic base. The declassification of a larger number of small towns, high variation in their growth rates, a smaller percentage of the towns registering a growth rate higher than sixty per cent, etc, on the other hand, are indications of their unstable economy. The differences in the pace and pattern of growth at the two levels of urban hierarchy seems to be a reflection, in space, of the dual structure of the Indian economy.},

  abstract = {The goals of ending extreme poverty by 2030 and working toward a more equal distribution of income are prominent in international development and agreed upon in the United Nations'Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 10. Using data from 164 countries comprising 97 percent of the world's population, this paper simulates a set of scenarios for global poverty from 2018 to 2030 under different assumptions about growth and inequality. This allows for quantifying the interdependence of the poverty and inequality goals. The paper uses different assumptions about growth incidence curves to model changes in inequality and relies on the Model-based Recursive Partitioning machine-learning algorithm to model how growth in GDP is passed through to growth as observed in household surveys. When holding within-country inequality unchanged and letting GDP per capita grow according to International Monetary Fund forecasts, the simulations suggest that the number of extreme poor (living below \$1.90/day) will remain above 550 million in 2030, resulting in a global extreme poverty rate of 6.5 percent. If the Gini index in each country decreases by 1 percent per year, the global poverty rate could reduce to around 5.4 percent in 2030, equivalent to 100 million fewer people living in extreme poverty. Reducing each country's Gini index by 1 percent per year has a larger impact on global poverty than increasing each country's annual growth 1 percentage point above the forecasts, suggesting an important role for inequality on the path to eliminating extreme poverty.},

  abstract = {The authors argue that spatial inequality of industry location is a primary cause of spatial income inequality in developing nations. Their study focuses on understanding the process of spatial industrial variation: identifying the spatial factors that have cost implications for firms, and the factors that influence the location decisions of new industrial units. The analysis has two parts. First the authors examine the contribution of economic geography factors to the cost structure of firms in eight industry sectors and show that local industrial diversity is the one factor with significant and substantial cost-reducing effects. They then show that new private sector industrial investments in India are biased toward existing industrial and coastal districts, whereas state industrial investments (in deep decline after structural reforms) are far less biased toward such districts. The authors conclude that structural reforms lead to increased spatial inequality in industrialization, and therefore, income. {\textcopyright} United Nations University 2005.},

Local technical staff and political leaders were trained to create and implement plans for the next 30 years of urban growth in their cities. The paper describes the role of knowledge exchange in empowering local government officials to implement the approach. It outlines the approach itself and then describes the process of knowledge exchange and the challenges and successes that resulted.},

This paper argues that the interrelations between urban planning, health, social, and environmental policies have been poorly articulated until now. Although sectoral approaches have often applied remedial and corrective measures to overcome unsatisfactory conditions in urban areas, today we know that infectious diseases stemming from insanitary conditions are not the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Europe. Nonetheless diverse forms of ill health remain associated with place of work and residence. Therefore, in order to deal with the complexity and diversity of urban areas there is an urgent need to move from conventional, sectoral approaches based on biomedical models of health to coordinated action stemming from an ecological interpretation of health including its social determinants. This kind of approach is presented in order to promote health and social development at the local level.},

  abstract = {This article concerns itself with home improvements - both as internalised process and externally visible practice - in African households in Cape Town, South Africa, under apartheid (1948-1994). It is argued that a historical analysis of home improvement provides an important portrayal not only of the structural changes to the homes in which urban Africans lived, but also of the underlying processes of settlement they undertook. The collection of trans-generational oral testimonies from 32 respondents across three generations of African women in selected households is central to the analysis, affording an original and nuanced view of both gendered and generational dynamics. This oral evidence is used in conjunction with written chronologies and schematically-drawn floor plans that detail renovations of predominantly City Council housing. The research indicates that Africans, and notably African women, did indeed 'grow' and improve their houses in particular ways, which in turn tended to reflect distinct historical trajectories. For example, 'first-generation' African women's choice of renovations in the early years of their residence in these council homes reflected both their need to fashion dwellings along very basic standards of comfort and respectability, and their hesitations over the insecurity of their tenure at the height of coercive state legislation. The ambitious scope of the expansion projects they undertook in the waning years of apartheid attested to a growing affirmation of their rootedness in the city, as homes increasingly became markers of first-generation women's urbanising selves. In contrast, in a radically altered political and social environment, younger generations developed differing notions of housing requirement and housing need. More distanced from community-based networks and more attuned to the benefits afforded by mobility in a broader sense, third-generation women freely contemplated and enthusiastically embraced future movement to other parts of the city or even to other urban areas. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Editorial Board of Journal of Southern African Studies.},

  abstract = {Model choice is one of the most crucial aspect in any statistical data analysis. It is well known that most models are just an approximation to the true data-generating process but among such model approximations, it is our goal to select the 'best' one. Researchers typically consider a finite number of plausible models in statistical applications, and the related statistical inference depends on the chosen model. Hence, model comparison is required to identify the 'best' model among several such candidate models. This article considers the problem of model selection for spatial data. The issue of model selection for spatial models has been addressed in the literature by the use of traditional information criteria-based methods, even though such criteria have been developed based on the assumption of independent observations. We evaluate the performance of some of the popular model selection critera via Monte Carlo simulation experiments using small to moderate samples. In particular, we compare the performance of some of the most popular information criteria such as Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion, and corrected AIC in selecting the true model. The ability of these criteria to select the correct model is evaluated under several scenarios. This comparison is made using various spatial covariance models ranging from stationary isotropic to nonstationary models.},

More recently, the generality of this finding has been questioned in studies that used new databases and different definitions of city boundaries. In this paper, we investigate the existence of nonlinear scaling, using a probabilistic framework in which fluctuations are accounted for explicitly. In particular, we show that this allows not only to (i) estimate {$\beta$} and confidence intervals, but also to (ii) quantify the evidence in favour of {$\beta\beta$} {$\neq$} 1 and (iii) test the hypothesis that the observations are compatible with the nonlinear scaling. We employ this framework to compare five different models to 15 different datasets and we find that the answers to points (i){\textendash}(iii) crucially depend on the fluctuations contained in the data, on how they are modelled, and on the fact that the city sizes are heavy-tailed distributed.},

Although it is widely assumed that local land use regulations{\textemdash}such as minimum lot sizes and growth controls{\textemdash}exclude low-income households from wealthier neighborhoods, the empirical research is surprisingly limited. We examine the relationship between land use regulation and segregation by income using new measures for the 95 biggest cities in the United States. We find that density restrictions are associated with the segregation of the wealthy and middle income, but not the poor. We also find that more local pressure to regulate land use is linked to higher rates of income segregation, but that more state control is connected to lowerincome segregation. Takeaway for practice: Density restrictions do drive urban income segregation of the rich, not the poor, but should be addressed because rich enclaves create significant metropolitan problems. Planners at the local level need assistance from regional and state efforts to ameliorate income segregation. Inclusionary housing requirements have a greater potential to reduce income segregation than bringing higher-income households into lower-income parts of the city. Finally, comprehensive and consistent data on the impacts of local land use regulations should be collected to inform future research and planning practice.},

Despite our support for the approach in this paper, we suggest that there are deeper issues than are currently acknowledged. Our critique tackles three issues: the empirical, the normative and the political. In the first section, we examine what counts as `behavioural' and how this label is used to legitimate a range of policy activities. We then look at randomised controlled trials in the next section, highlighting the extra-scientific dimensions of the empirical `What Works' revolution. Finally, we question some ontological assumptions that drive empirical research and its translation into policy, asking where the collective is to be found in behavioural public policy.},

Evaluation of the effect of commuting duration on job and housing tenure suggests that those who move, on average, maintain commute duration rather than having a major increase or decrease. This corroborates the idea that there are offsetting factors, where increases in commute lengths due to suburbanizing residences are counteracted by the correlated process of suburbanizing jobs.},

  abstract = {Energy economy models are central to decision making on energy and climate issues in the 21st century, such as informing the design of deep decarbonisation strategies under the Paris Agreement. Designing policies that are aimed at achieving such radical transitions in the energy system will require ever more in-depth modelling of end-use demand, efficiency and fuel switching, as well as an increasing need for regional, sectoral, and agent disaggregation to capture technological, jurisdictional and policy detail. Building and using these models entails complex trade-offs between the level of detail, the size of the system boundary, and the available computing resources. The availability of data to characterise key energy system sectors and interactions is also a key driver of model structure and parameterisation, and there are many blind spots and design compromises that are caused by data scarcity. We may soon, however, live in a world of data abundance, potentially enabling previously impossible levels of resolution and coverage in energy economy models. But while big data concepts and platforms have already begun to be used in a number of selected energy research applications, their potential to improve or even completely revolutionise energy economy modelling has been almost completely overlooked in the existing literature. In this paper, we explore the challenges and possibilities of this emerging frontier. We identify critical gaps and opportunities for the field, as well as developing foundational concepts for guiding the future application of big data to energy economy modelling, with reference to the existing literature on decision making under uncertainty, scenario analysis and the philosophy of science.},

Recent cases and studies show that a key factor in this transformation is the use of urban big data from stakeholders and physical objects in cities. However, the knowledge and framework for data use for smart cities remain relatively unknown. This paper reports findings from an analysis of various use cases of big data in cities worldwide and the authors' four projects with government organizations toward developing smart cities. Specifically, this paper classifies the urban data use cases into four reference models and identifies six challenges in transforming data into information for smart cities. Furthermore, building upon the relevant literature, this paper proposes five considerations for addressing the challenges in implementing the reference models in real-world applications. The reference models, challenges, and considerations collectively form a framework for data use for smart cities. This paper will contribute to urban planning and policy development in the modern data-rich economy.},

Using a bipartite network approach, we develop several weighted centrality-based connectivities to quantify the degree of dependencies of urban bus transit on streets. Two megacities with different road patterns, i.e., Beijing and Shanghai in China are taken as examples to depict comparatively spatial inequalities of the centrality-based dependencies at both local and global scales. Then, a series of spatial cross-section regression models are introduced to explore the colocation relationships between the dependencies of bus transit and urban socioeconomic intensities. The methodology of kernel density estimation (KDE) is used to convert all data with different scales into the same unit of measurement. Results indicate that there are significant statistical and spatial inequalities of the centrality-based dependencies of bus transit on urban streets. These inequalities with evident hierarchies, variances and clusters were validated by statistical analysis including power-law function, rank-size distribution, multiple variance indices, together with Global Moran's I. Besides, a majority of bus transit rely heavily on minor streets concentrating on circumferential expressways in central urban areas and radial highways oriented to outer suburbs under industrial or residential suburbanization. The unequal distribution is found to be strongly related to population, nighttime light intensity, transport-related services, and commercial and leisure services by the spatial regression models. A good spatial matching between bus routes' dependencies and socioeconomic activities intensities is found both in these two megacities.},

As income grew, urban sprawl usually became more severe. Moreover, from a dynamic perspective, all MAs had grown in a sprawling manner compared with the patterns in the base year of 2000 and within the same income group.

Urban scaling theory provides a quantitative framework to explore the temporal change of urban properties against city size and reveal if urbanization is balanced or not. We modeled urban allometries for Chinese cities from 1984 to 2019 and quantified the variation in the scaling exponents for assessing the degree of unbalanced development across urban functions. We found urban China had weaker scaling relationships than its developed counterparts. The exponents for most urban functions showed different trajectories from those of developed countries and did not converge to the theoretical exponents. The temporally divergent exponents showed a strong unbalanced development, particularly between socio-economic and social service functions. Our study indicates that although unbalanced development could stimulate urban growth, excessive imbalance ultimately limits urban development of Chinese cities. The best urban development is achieved at an intermediate functional imbalance.},

To this end the WorldPop Project is producing an open access archive of 3 and 30 arc-second ({$\sim$}100m and {$\sim$}1km, respectively) resolution gridded data in a predominantly open source environment, using OSGEO4W utilities. Five tiled raster datasets form the basis of the archive: (i) Viewfinder Panoramas topography clipped to CIESIN national level administrative coastlines; (ii) a matching ISO 3166 country identification grid; (iii) country area; (iv) pixel area; (v) and slope layer. Further layers will include transport networks, landcover, urban extent, nightlights, climate, travel time to major cities, forest stand change, livestock densities, vegetation indices, and waterways. We here describe the base datasets and the production methodology in development. The alpha version of the archive can be downloaded both from the WorldPop Dataverse Repository and the WorldPop Project website. The improved and expanded beta version of the archive is in development for release next year, and will offer significantly improved standardisation of country boundaries, and inland water boundaries (forthcoming), to global census unit data.},

Here we show that a microscopic derivation of urban scaling relations for economic quantities vs. population, obtained from the consideration of social and infrastructural properties common to all cities, implies an effective model of economic output in the form of a Cobb-Douglas type production function. As a result we derive a new expression for the Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of urban areas, which is the standard measure of economic productivity per unit of aggregate production factors (labor and capital). Using these results we empirically demonstrate that there is a systematic dependence of urban productivity on city population size, resulting from the mismatch between the size dependence of wages and labor, so that in contemporary US cities productivity increases by about 11\% with each doubling of their population. Moreover, deviations from the average scale dependence of economic output, capturing the effect of local factors, including history and other local contingencies, also manifest surprising regularities. Although, productivity is maximized by the combination of high wages and low labor input, high productivity cities show invariably high wages and high levels of employment relative to their size expectation. Conversely, low productivity cities show both low wages and employment. These results shed new light on the microscopic processes that underlie urban economic productivity, explain the emergence of effective aggregate urban economic output models in terms of labor and capital inputs and may inform the development of economic theory related to growth. {\textcopyright} 2013 Lobo et al.},

We apply this method to a set of 131 cities in the world, and at an intermediate level of the dendrogram, we observe four large families of cities characterized by different abundances of blocks of a certain area and shape. At a lower level of the classification, we find that most European cities and American cities in our sample fall in their own sub-category, highlighting quantitatively the differences between the typical layouts of cities in both regions. We also show with the example of New York and its different boroughs, that the fingerprint of a city can be seen as the sum of the ones characterizing the different neighbourhoods inside a city.

In particular, we show that the dependence on population size of the total number of miles driven daily, the total length of the road network, the total traffic delay, the total consumption of gasoline, the quantity of CO2 emitted and the relation between area and population of cities, are all governed by a single parameter which characterizes the sensitivity to congestion. Our results suggest that diseconomies associated with congestion scale superlinearly with population size, implying that-despite polycentrism-cities whose transportation infrastructure rely heavily on traffic sensitive modes are unsustainable.},

Results found that increases in population density combined with strict building standards and retrofitting older buildings decreased per person emissions per year by up to 84\% by 2050. Within the neighbourhoodscale areas, building form and location had less impact. Population density and frequency of transit service were most important for mobility mode shifts. Concentrating density at transit nodes or along commercial corridors improved the percentages of residents within a fiveminute walk of those services, but proximity to greenspaces showed mixed results.},

However, understanding this is highly relevant for policymakers to understand the impacts of their transport decisions. These dimensions include the distribution of mobility and accessibility levels over particular areas or for specific population groups, as well as how this may affect various social outcomes, including their levels of participation, social inclusion and community cohesion. In response, we propose a method to assess the socially relevant accessibility impacts (SRAIs) of policies in some of these key dimensions. The method combines the use of underlying ethics principles, more specifically the theories of egalitarianism and sufficientarianism, in combination with accessibility-based analysis and the Lorenz curve and Gini index. We then demonstrate the method in a case study example. Our suggestion is that policymakers can use these ethical perspectives to determine the equity of their policies decisions and to set minimum standards for local transport delivery. This will help them to become more confident in the development and adoption of new decision frameworks that promote accessibility over mobility and which also disaggregate the costs and benefits of transport policies over particular areas or for specific under-served population groups.},

The economic adjustment effects of long-term climate policy are investigated based on the cross-comparison of the intertemporal optimization models ReMIND-R and WITCH as well as the recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model IMACLIM-R. A number of robust findings emerge. If the international community takes immediate action to mitigate climate change, the costs of stabilizing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations at 450 ppm (roughly 530-550 ppm-e) discounted at 3\% are estimated to be 1. 4\% or lower of global consumption over the twenty-first century. Second best settings with either a delay in climate policy or restrictions to the deployment of low-carbon technologies can result in substantial increases of mitigation costs. A delay of global climate policy until 2030 would render the 450 ppm target unachievable. Renewables and CCS are found to be the most critical mitigation technologies, and all models project a rapid switch of investments away from freely emitting energy conversion technologies towards renewables, CCS and nuclear. Concerning end use sectors, the models consistently show an almost full scale decarbonization of the electricity sector by the middle of the twenty-first century, while the decarbonization of non-electric energy demand, in particular in the transport sector remains incomplete in all mitigation scenarios. The results suggest that assumptions about low-carbon alternatives for non-electric energy demand are of key importance for the costs and achievability of very low stabilization scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Smart urbanism discourses are deeply rooted in seductive and normative visions of the future where digital technology stands as the primary driver for change. Yet our understanding of the opportunities, challenges, and implications of smart urbanism is limited. Research in this field is in its infancy, fragmented along disciplinary lines and often based on single city case studies. As a result, we lack both the theoretical insight and empirical evidence required to assess the implications of this potentially transformative phenomenon. Given the significant implications of smart urbanism there is an urgent need to critically engage with why, how, for whom and with what consequences smart urbanism is emerging in different urban contexts. The aim of this review is to unpack the different logics and rationales behind smart urbanism discourses and proposals, and in this way understand the ways by which imaginaries of urban futures are currently being constructed, along with their socio-technical and political implications for future research priorities.},

  abstract = {The future paths of population ageing result from specific combinations of declining fertility and increasing life expectancies in different parts of the world. Here we measure the speed of population ageing by using conventional measures and new ones that take changes in longevity into account for the world as a whole and for 13 major regions. We report on future levels of indicators of ageing and the speed at which they change. We show how these depend on whether changes in life expectancy are taken into account. We also show that the speed of ageing is likely to increase over the coming decades and to decelerate in most regions by mid-century. All our measures indicate a continuous ageing of the world's population throughout the century. The median age of the world's population increases from 26.6 years in 2000 to 37.3 years in 2050 and then to 45.6 years in 2100, when it is not adjusted for longevity increase. When increases in life expectancy are taken into account, the adjusted median age rises from 26.6 in 2000 to 31.1 in 2050 and only to 32.9 in 2100, slightly less than what it was in the China region in 2005. There are large differences in the regional patterns of ageing. In North America, the median age adjusted for life expectancy change falls throughout almost the entire century, whereas the conventional median age increases significantly. Our assessment of trends in ageing is based on new probabilistic population forecasts. The probability that growth in the world's population will end during this century is 88\%, somewhat higher than previously assessed. After mid-century, lower rates of population growth are likely to coincide with slower rates of ageing. {\textcopyright}2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

  abstract = {Interest in nature-based approaches for climate change adaptation in cities is growing. Whilst there is a growing field of scholarship in a European and North America setting, research on the policy and governance of urban greenspace for climate adaptation in subtropical Asia is limited. Given the different development patterns, environmental characteristics and governance arrangements in subtropical cities, plus their comparatively large population and high climate risk, this is a significant knowledge gap. In response, this paper evaluates compe\- tences {\textendash} skill sets, capabilities, and supporting policy and legislation {\textendash} to enact adaptation through greenspace across different governance contexts; and assesses how international rhetoric on nature-based adaptation be\- comes localised to subtropical Asian city settings. We conduct interviews with stakeholders, plus review of relevant policy and city-specific research, for three cities with different governance and development contexts: Hanoi (Vietnam); Taipei (Taiwan); and Fukuoka (Japan). Across all three cases, we find that institutional structures and processes for connecting different remits and knowledge systems are a bigger challenge than a lack of appropriate policy or individuals with the required technical knowledge. However, opportunities for civil society participation and consideration of justice issues vary between the cities according to the socio-political context. These findings illustrate the value of individuals and organisations able to work across institutional boundaries in linking greenspace and adaptation agendas for subtropical Asian cities; and the importance of competence in collaboration with developers and civil society so that the rapid development or regeneration seen in subtropical Asian contexts does not tend towards green climate gentrification. More broadly, our findings show that the diverse nature of subtropical Asian cities means the role of greenspace in climate adaptation is likely to be context-specific, and thus that caution must be exercised against uncritically importing best practices from exemplar cases elsewhere.},

  abstract = {There is increasing advocacy from academics, international agenda-setting organisations, and cities themselves for expert- and evidence driven approaches to multiple aspects of urban climate change and sustainability, including nature-based solutions. However, given growing interest in nature-based solutions research and practice towards questions of justice, it is important that the knowledge systems used to inform decisions about urban nature-based solutions are critically scrutinised. We use the lens of epistemic justice {\textendash} justice in knowl\- edge, with regard to how society defines a problem and the range of possible solutions {\textendash} to assess nature-based solutions actions for climate adaptation and resilience across five cities: Amsterdam, Glasgow, Hanoi, Oslo, and Taipei. Our study finds common issues: the risk of quantifiable evidence about the distribution of NbS and its benefits closing down the aims of NbS strategies to meeting narrowly-defined indicators; the potential for selfdefined communities of experts becoming de facto authorities on NbS; and the need for those tasked with implementing NbS `on the ground' to have access to the fora and knowledge systems in which NbS strategies are developed. A key message is that more participation alone is insufficient to address epistemic justice concerns, unless it comes at a stage where a broad range of stakeholders (and their knowledges) can influence adaptation strategies and the role of NbS within them. Given the inter- and transdisciplinary nature of NbS scholarship, we argue attention must be focused on the potential for exclusion of key knowledge systems from policy and governance processes.},

The picture that emerges from this particular perspective is one in which convergence is often confined to groups of geographically contiguous regions. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines the origins, development, and implementation of the Group Areas Act in Durban. The key argument of this paper is that the anti-Indian agitation of the Durban City Council and its White electorate played an important role in the development of the legislation. Whites in Durban were at the forefront of calls for the compulsory segregation of Indians because this group presented a serious threat in terms of competition for social and economic space. The local state in Durban worked closely with the central state and played a key role in the formulation and implementation of the Group Areas Act. In all of the race zoning proposals for the City of Durban, the views of the White electorate were considered by the local state, but those of the disenfranchised Indians were disregarded. The local state in Durban was, however, forced to review its race zoning plans when it became apparent that the central state expected it to bear the costs of uprooting hundreds of thousands of people. Despite numerous appeals by the local state and Indian political and civic organizations, the spatial impress of the central state was imposed upon the local state.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this chapter is to survey recent research on housing markets and policy in what used to be called the "second" and "third" worlds. We adopt the labels "transition" economies to refer to countries as disparate as Russia and Vietnam, and "developing" to refer to countries as disparate as Korea and Singapore (arguably now developed) and countries like Mozambique and Laos. It is therefore quite interesting that the bulk of the research surveyed finds that housing market behavior is remarkably similar from place to place. Institutions and constraints, particularly the amount of income available for housing and other goods and services certainly do vary dramatically from place to place. And the stakes of how well housing markets work vary from place to place. But these differences in institutions and constraints do not obscure regularities in behavior. The first major section, on housing markets (Section 2), examines property rights, supply, demand and tenure. Section 3 presents research on the related markets for land, finance and infrastructure. Housing policy is covered in Section 4, including housing subsidy systems, privatization, taxation and regulation. Section 5 concludes with a discussion of current issues and research. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Despite widespread and mounting interest in ABM, even broader adoption has been hindered by a set of methodological challenges that run from issues around basic tools to the need for a more complete conceptual foundation for the approach. After several decades of progress, ABMs remain difficult to develop and use for many students, scholars, and policy makers. This difficulty holds especially true for models designed to represent spatial patterns and processes across a broad range of human, natural, and human-environment systems. In this paper, we describe the methodological challenges facing further development and use of spatial ABM (SABM) and suggest some potential solutions from multiple disciplines. We first define SABM to narrow our object of inquiry, and then explore how spatiality is a source of both advantages and challenges. We examine how time interacts with space in models and delve into issues of model development in general and modeling frameworks and tools specifically. We draw on lessons and insights from fields with a history of ABM contributions, including economics, ecology, geography, ecology, anthropology, and spatial science with the goal of identifying promising ways forward for this powerful means of modeling.},

However, we also find that when endogeneity is dealt with urbanization mitigates the effect of climate varia- tions on international migration. We estimate that temperature and rainfall variations caused a total displacement of 2.35 million people in net terms over the period 1960-2000 in sub-Saharan Africa, and predict that climate variations, based on IPCC scenarios, will lead to an additional annual displacement of 1.4 million people.},

The article focuses on the spatial politics of this protest, analysing the particular strategies it used to activise urban public space. The protest initially reflected a specific urban context and limited agenda-namely, the lack of affordable housing in Tel Aviv. However, as it materialised and expanded in public space, it also became more inclusive, incorporating more marginalised publics and places, addressing long-standing socio-spatial inequalities between Israel's 'centre' and 'periphery', and advancing a message of 'social justice'-with the noted exception of Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. The analysis of the Israeli protest foregrounds some dynamics that it shares with other 'global' protests in 2011, from Tahrir Square to Occupy Wall Street, pointing to the spatial politics of centrality, multiplicity and 'media-space', a mutually enforcing relationship between physical public space and mainstream and social media. {\textcopyright} 2013 Urban Studies Journal Limited.},

However, these traditional spatial inequality measures like the Theil index do not distinguish among different locational situations. On the other hand, when analyzing the spatial decomposition of inequality, it is usual to express global inequality as a weighted sum of inequality values calculated for population subgroups (within component) plus the contribution arising out of differences among subgroup means (between component). Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the reported within and between contributions have been driven primarily by specific factors related to the spatial level of research or by neighborhood factors. The present paper has two main objectives. The first consists into propose a simple way to measure the role of the geographical position in economic inequality. The second aim is to provide an approach to decompose global inequality into its within-country and between-country components assessing which part of these components could be related to neighborhood factors. The proposals are illustrated for the case of European countries. Inequality within each of the countries and inequality between countries can be filtered of neighborhood components, showing inequality components related to specific (local) factors. For a considered spatial level, this exploratory approach can highlight the relevance of future place-based policies versus policies able to support and promote regional neighborhoods.},

  abstract = {The use of location based social networks{\textemdash}LBSNs{\textemdash}for diagnosing phenomena in contemporary cities is evolving at a fast pace. However, methodological frameworks for informing urban regeneration at a fine-grain neighborhood scale through LBSNs is still by and large an unchartered territory, which this research seeks to address. This research bridges the knowledge gap by proposing a method to identify urban opportunity spaces for urban regeneration that involves pre-processing, analyzing and interpreting single and overlapped LBSN data. A two-fold perspective{\textemdash}people-based and place-based{\textemdash}is adopted. Data from four LBSNs{\textemdash}Foursquare, Twitter, Google Places and Airbnb{\textemdash}represent the people-based approach as it offers an insight into individual preferences, use and activities. The place-based approach is provided by an illustrative case study. Local unexpected nuances were gathered by the interlinking of data from different LBSNs, and opportunity places for urban regeneration have been recognized, as well as potential itineraries to boost urban liveliness and connectivity at both intra and inter- neighborhood scales. Findings show that overlapping data from various LBSNs enriches the analysis that would previously have relied on a single source.},

  abstract = {How do Anglophone urban scholars know urban informalities? This article reviews three dominant ways of knowing urban informality, noting that, despite the profoundly rich insights they each provide, two critiques of the overall concept endure. These are that the concept is often imprecise, and that the contribution to knowing `the urban' more generally remains clearly circumscribed to the `urban non-west'. In our view, these limitations curtail the possibilities of sharpening our understanding of the relationship to inequalities and injustices. We work with these critiques, suggesting that they represent two sides of the same problem, associated with binaries. In doing so, we build on the existing emphasis on practices and work across the three dominant ways of knowing urban informalities. This reveals that binaries are not held together magically and transparently so that each is the mirror opposite. Instead, the difference is constituted through unnamed aspects of common denominators {\textendash} two of which we highlight (property rights and aesthetics) {\textendash} and may be intrinsic to the way urban informality has come to develop. It is through the latent power relations that inhere in these common denominators that urban scholars can achieve greater conceptual precision and make different contributions to broader urban theory committed to challenging injustices.},

The individual elements of the strategy are then reviewed and innovations identified in demand management, public transport service provision and information technology.

  abstract = {The paper contributes to the conceptualization of cities in the world by first outlining the conceptual and empirical challenges of theorizing the urban/global nexus in both relational and territorial terms. It argues that the most useful and appropriate approach to understanding contemporary urban governance in global context is to develop a conceptualization that is equally sensitive to the role of relational and territorial geographies, of fixity and flow, of global contexts and place-specificities (and vice versa), of structural imperatives and embodied practices, in the production of cities. In order to illustrate the benefits of this conceptualization, the paper will apply it to the case of how downtown development is governed in many contemporary cities. The role of the Business Improvement District (BID) program and New Urbanist planning models in shaping downtowns will be examined in terms of: (1) how and by whom these models are developed in a global-relational context and are set in motion through scaled circuits of policy knowledge and (2) how the mobilization of these models are conditioned by their territorialization in specific spatial and political economic contexts. The paper emphasizes that the 'local globalness' of policy models like BIDs and New Urbanism and their consequences for cities can best be understood through a combined focus on relationality and territoriality. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {This article proposes an agenda for research into the spatial, social, and relational character of globally circulating urban policies, policy models, and policy knowledge. It draws on geographical political economy literatures that analyze particular social processes in terms of wider sociospatial contexts, in part by maintaining a focus on the dialectics of fixity and flow. The article combines this perspective with poststructuralist arguments about the analytical benefits of close studies of the embodied practices, representations, and expertise through which policy knowledge is mobilized. I suggest that the notion of mobilities offers a useful rubric under which to operationalize this approach to the "local globalness" of urban policy transfer. The utility of this research approach is illustrated by the example of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, a city that is frequently referenced by policymakers elsewhere as they look for "hot" policy ideas. The case also indicates that there is much research yet to be done on the character and implications of interurban policy transfer. Specifically, I argue that, while maintaining a focus on wider forces, studies of urban policy mobilities must take seriously the role that apparently banal activities of individual policy transfer agents play in the travels of policy models and must also engage in fine-grained qualitative studies of how policies are carried from place to place, learned in specific settings, and changed as they move. The final section offers theoretical and methodological questions and considerations that can frame future research into how, why, and with what consequences urban policies are mobilized globally. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Association of American Geographers.},

  abstract = {Recent processes of European integration have influenced profoundly the fortunes of cities across Western Europe. Although some cities have benefited, others have been impacted adversely. Income inequalities result from economic growth differentials occurring between different cities over time. The theoretical literature differs on whether increased integration promotes or reduces income disparities. The European Union (EU) assumes that rising inequalities will impair EU growth and lead to even greater disparities. Empirical analysis has concentrated on the EU-defined regions because of problems of urban data availability and comparability. Using regional data, I identified that the overall level of inequalities changed little for the metropolitan regions between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. Urban disparities were cyclical-decreasing during strong EU growth and increasing in slower growth years. Factors outside direct local government control, including relative location within Europe, reinforced the traditional strong-core-weak-periphery spatial pattern of development. I argue that additional factors specific to cities, such as limited EU urban policy and funding, contributed to overall higher and more sharply rising inequalities since the late 1980s for cities compared with regions. The positive linear relationship between levels of national income and urban disparities has implications for economic polarization within richer member states and for EU efforts to reduce inequalities by raising the level of development in poorer countries.},

Existing epistemologies of comparative research have focused on the domains of practicalities, methodologies and typologies. Notwithstanding the value of these debates, this article offers an alternative framing of comparison that focuses attention on theory cultures, learning and ethico-politics, drawing on postcolonial debates. This approach works with an expansive conception of comparison that positions comparison as a strategy.

I offer a conception of learning based on three processes: translation, or the relational distributions through which learning is produced as a sociomaterial epistemology of displacement and change; coordination, or the construction of functional systems that enable learning as a means of linking different forms of knowledge, coping with complexity and facilitating adaptation; and dwelling, or the education of attention through which learning operates as a way of seeing and inhabiting the world. I then consider this conception of learning in relation to tactical learning, i.e. the resources marginal groups use to cope with, negotiate and resist in the city, and urban learning forums, i.e. the possibilities for progressive forms of learning between different constituencies in the city. I conclude with an outline of a critical urbanism of learning. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author.

  abstract = {Climatic variability and change is known to influence human migration patterns. Researchers increasingly see migration as one of a range of potential means by which populations may adapt to the future impacts of climate change. Modelling of climate change-related migration is a relatively new undertaking. This article provides a brief overview of current scholarly understanding of climate change-related migration processes, identifies recent developments and current challenges in modelling, and suggests opportunities for enhancing future modelling efforts. Given the lack of reliable global datasets on environmentally related migration, regional and sub-regional modelling of climate change effects on migration is where most developments are likely to emerge in the short-run. Such models, which can draw on a range of GIS-based and statistical approaches, at present make use of fairly general assumptions about migration behavior, and therefore best serve as gauges of potential trends and migration hotspots, and not as absolute predictors of future migrant numbers. Models will become increasingly sophisticated as scholarly understanding of underlying factors influencing migration behavior, such as risk perception, social networks, and labor market connections, is improved. Obtaining reliable data for use in such models will remain a significant challenge in coming years. International policymakers seeking to expand the predictive capacity of models are encouraged to use existing mechanisms such as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change to develop protocols and mechanisms for collecting and sharing reliable data on climate-related population movements. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract = {"The 1977 book A Pattern Language was a landmark in the design world, introducing methodology that has since become remarkably widespread and effective across many fields. Among them is software, where 'design patterns' have since become and industry standard. Important spinoffs include peer-to-peer collaboration technologies like wiki -- the basis of Wikipedia and related innovations -- as well as Agile Methodology. Yet curiously, the one field where pattern methodology has lagged most conspicuously is the one where it began, the built environment. In part, the popular appeal of the 1977 book served to 'freeze' the initial set of patterns, greatly slowing further peer-to-peer development -- contrary to the original authors' stated aims. As one remedy we present here, in one of many hoped-for future companion volumes to the original classic book, a new collection of 80 patterns for a new era of urban challenges. Its authors include several long-time collaborators of the original lead author A Pattern Language. This new collection emerged in part from a five-year collaboration with UN-Habitat to address new urban challenges, including rapid urbanization, slum upgrading, sustainable urbanism, emerging technologies, and new tools and strategies to meet these and other challenges. However, there remains an urgent need to develop and share tools and strategies grounded in research evidence, and subject to revision, addition, and refinement, with new findings from new collaborators. "This volume aims to meet that need -- together with the launch of an online companion pattern 'repository', available at npl.wiki. Both initiatives were developed in collaboration with Ward Cunningham, wiki inventor, and pioneer of pattern languages of programming as well as Agile Methodology. Both are meant to expand the capacity of pattern languages in support of a hopeful new era of open-source, human-centered, life-enriching technology."},

Here we present the first global database combining such information with city extents. The Global Human Settlement Urban Centre Database (GHS-UCDB) is produced by geospatial data integration to characterise more than 10,000 urban centres worldwide. The database is multi-dimensional and multi-temporal, containing 28 variables across five domains and having multitemporal attributes for one or more epochs when the UC are delineated (1975-1990-2000-2015). Delineation of urban centres for the year 2015 is performed via a logic of grid cell population density, population size, and grid cell contiguity defined by the Degree of Urbanisation method. Each of the urban centres has 160 attributes, including a validation assessment. The novel aspects of this database concern the thematic richness and temporal depth of the variables (across geography, socio-economic, environmental, disaster risk reduction, and sustainable development domains) and the type of geo-information provided (location and extent), featuring an overall consistency that allows comparative analyses across locations and time.},

There is however a widespread perception that a ``knowing-to-doing'' gap hinders the uptake of knowledge for conservation action. Vague reasoning on who is to take action is pointed here as a significant component of that problem. As conservation scientists discuss options on how to bridge that gap, they have to reflect on issues of agency and organization: who do they see as taking action? What does significant action essentially consist in? And what is the fundamental structure of the relations and power dynamics between the actors involved? Based on such questions, we propose here a typology of six underlying conceptual models of organized action that are used (implicitly or explicitly) to reflect and debate on action for conservation. We analyse the system of crossed critiques that result from the differences in their premises on agency and organization. This clarification allows a better understanding of recurrent controversies in the conservation field, and can help conservation scientists be more explicit about their strategic choices as they increasingly focus on the kind of action they want their research to inform.},

  abstract = {The `turn' to biographical methods has been popular in adult education research as well as the social sciences in general. In recent years in Europe, various conferences and, more recently, the editing of a European book have provided the opportunity (and challenge) of considering the current state of play in relation to the development of these methodologies. This partly concerns what such approaches may contribute to an understanding of adult and lifelong learning in diverse settings. They also provide an opportunity to develop conversations and understanding around the purpose of research as well as theoretical, disciplinary, paradigmatic, ideological and even terminological similarities, and differences, both within Europe and between continents. There is a diversity of intellectual traditions in Europe shaping research, including interpretivism, hermeneutics, social constructivism, symbolic interactionism, feminism, critical theory, narrative theory, psychoanalysis and psychosocial perspectives. While theoretical diversity enriches biographical research in adult education it can also raise challenges in understanding and communicating with each other locally and globally. This paper outlines and illustrates what has been termed `the turn' to biographical approaches (we use `biography' as an umbrella word for a family with many names: auto/biographical, life history and narrative research, for instance, each having some distinctiveness). We highlight, firstly, particular developments, especially in the study of adult and lifelong learning. Second, we delineate some of the `challenges' in the family of biographical researchers: around language and disciplinary cultures as well as notions of objectivity, subjectivity and intersubjectivity in research, including the role of the researcher. Lastly, we describe how research is enriching our understanding of subjectivity, and of what it is to learn, in all its `psychosocial' dimensions. This paper draws on the European context but uses this to broaden and extend the conversation to a global one in asking how far do our experiences resonate with those in Canada and North America and beyond?},

  abstract = {Defining urban morphology in terms of the shape and density of urban land use has hitherto depended upon the informed yet subjective recognition of patterns consistent with spatial theory. In this paper we exploit the potential of urban image analysis from remotely sensed data to detect, then measure, various elements of urban form and its land use, thus providing a basis for consistent definition and thence comparison. First, we introduce methods for classifying urban areas and individual land uses from remotely sensed images by using conventional maximum likelihood discriminators which utilize the spectral densities associated with different elements of the image. As a benchmark to our classifications, we use smoothed UK Population Census data. From the analysis we then extract various definitions of the urban area and its distinct land uses which we represent in terms of binary surfaces arrayed on fine grids with resolutions of approximately 20 m and 30 m. These images form surfaces which reveal both the shape of land use and its density in terms of the amount of urban space filled, and these provide the data for subsequent density analysis. This analysis is based upon fractal theory in which densities of occupancy at different distances from fixed points are modeled by means of power functions. We illustrate this for land use in Bristol, England, extracted from Landsat TM-5 and SPOT HRV images and dimensioned from population census data for 1981 and 1991. We provide for the first time, not only fractal measurements of the density of different land uses but measures of the temporal change in these densities.},

The resetting of Britain's urban network gave it better access to natural navigable waterways, which mattered for town growth from 1200 to 1800.

These facts raise two questions. First, how have female-headed households fared? Second, what role have they played in Africa's impressive recent aggregate growth and poverty reduction? Using data covering the entire region, we reexamine the current prevalence and characteristics of female-headed households and ask whether their prevalence has been rising, what factors have been associated with such changes since the mid-1990s, and whether poverty has fallen equiproportionately for male- and female-headed households. Lower female headship is associated with higher gross domestic product. However, other subtle transformations occurring across Africa{\textemdash}changes in marriage behavior, family formation, health, and education{\textemdash}are positively related to female headship, resulting in a growing share of female-headed households. This shift has been happening alongside declining aggregate poverty incidence. However, rather than being left behind, female-headed households have generally seen faster poverty reduction. As a whole, this group has contributed substantially to the reduction in poverty despite their smaller share in the population.},

  abstract = {A Monte Carlo evaluation of 30 procedures for determining the number of clusters was conducted on artificial data sets which contained either 2, 3, 4, or 5 distinct nonoverlapping clusters. To provide a variety of clustering solutions, the data sets were analyzed by four hierarchical clustering methods. External criterion measures indicated excellent recovery of the true cluster structure by the methods at the correct hierarchy level. Thus, the clustering present in the data was quite strong. The simulation results for the stopping rules revealed a wide range in their ability to determine the correct number of clusters in the data. Several procedures worked fairly well, whereas others performed rather poorly. Thus, the latter group of rules would appear to have little validity, particularly for data sets containing distinct clusters. Applied researchers are urged to select one or more of the better criteria. However, users are cautioned that the performance of some of the criteria may be data dependent. {\textcopyright} 1985 The Psychometric Society.},

This high unemployment rate has been a chronic problem and has been at these or similar levels since the democratic transition in 1994. Unemployment rates were probably also very high for a substantial period before 1994, but the lack of suitable data from that period makes precise measurement of the unemployment rates for that era quite impossible. We make use of the first three waves of the nationally representative longitudinal dataset obtained from the National Income Dynamics Study, to explore the factors that assist school leavers in finding employment. By means of descriptive statistics and regression analyses, we estimate the differences in job finding rates by gender, geographical location, educational attainment, household structure and migration status. Our results are not particularly surprising. Male youth, better educated youth, and youth who migrate from rural areas to urban areas tend to have better job prospects on leaving school.},

  abstract = {Road networks are characterised by several structural and geometrical properties. The topological structure determines partially the hierarchical arrangement of roads, but since these are networks that are spatially constrained, geometrical properties play a fundamental role in determining the network's behaviour, characterising the influence of each of the street segments on the system. In this work, we apply percolation theory to the UK's road network using the relative angle between street segments as the occupation probability. The appearance of the spanning cluster is marked by a phase transition, indicating that the system behaves in a critical way. Computing Shannon's entropy of the cluster sizes, different stages of the percolation process can be discerned, and these indicate that roads integrate to the giant cluster in a hierarchical manner. This is used to construct a hierarchical index that serves to classify roads in terms of their importance. The obtained classification is in very good correspondence with the official designations of roads. This methodology hence provides a framework to consistently extract the main skeleton of an urban system and to further classify each road in terms of its hierarchical importance within the system.},

Much has been published on how such cities learn from each other in the global North, as well as some in Latin America and Asia, but little empirical research is available relating to sub-Saharan Africa. As a result, not much is known about the perception of practitioners in this part of the world, of prevailing international learning nomenclature, or of their understanding and interpretation of the dynamics of associated complex learning processes. This article focuses on a case study of the international United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) ``mentorship programme'' involving the eThekwini Municipality in Durban, South Africa, and the cities of Otjiwarongo in Namibia and Mzuzu in Malawi. Instead of a single, unified and coherent conceptualisation of city-to-city learning, the study unearthed a messy and complex picture of multiple understandings of this concept among learning stakeholders. Crucially, it exposed strong resistance from African practitioners to the UCLG learning terminology of ``city mentorship'', yielding a call to policy-makers for greater sensitivity about definitions of key constructs. Whilst making the case for city-to-city learning, it provides new insights that can contribute to more nuanced understandings of the complexity and the politics of knowledge transfer among cities.},

Little empirical work has been done however, to critically analyse exactly how knowledge is transferred and the conditions under which these happen in order to facilitate better policy transfer between southern cities and regions. This paper focuses on the experiences of urban planning practitioners and key stakeholders from cities in South Africa, Malawi and Namibia that participated in a mentorship program coordinated by the international United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG). Using this case study, it develops a staged learning model that unpacks in detail, the mechanics of how the learning occurs during the program. In order to inform good practice, key ingredients that contribute to knowledge transfer {\textendash} in this instance around urban strategic planning {\textendash} is distilled. The study employed a qualitative approach combining observation, focus group and in-depth interviews with 18 practitioners directly involved in the program. The study shows that effective knowledge transfer requires inter-alia an expertly-facilitated and highly structured program of mutual learning. Most importantly however, the paper argues that the building of trust between the practitioners involved in city-to-city learning is critical for transformative action in cities of the global South.},

Although much is known about the private return to education, much less is known about the more important question of what happens to productivity, wages and land prices when the aggregate stock of human capital in a city increases. Increases in the aggregate stock of human capital can benefit society in ways that are not fully reflected in the private return of education. Human capital spillovers can in theory increase aggregate productivity over and above the direct effect of human capital on individual productivity. Furthermore, increases in education can reduce criminal participation and improve voters' political behavior. In this chapter, I review what we know about social returns to education, with a particular emphasis on those externalities that accrue to local geographic areas. The focus of the chapter is on the empirical issues that arise in identifying these externalities and on the existing empirical evidence on their magnitude. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {In this article we explore the dynamic between the pedagogical and the urban, attending to `agentive urban learning'. By this we mean processes by which young people build agency in the urban context, in using the resources of the city to develop their own agency, and of developing agency to act within the city. By agency, we refer to the capacity to imagine and act to create individual and collective futures. Our interest is how young people develop such agentive urban learning themselves and how it might be enhanced pedagogically at school and university. Three case studies explore different facets{\textemdash}the first how young people themselves develop this agency in situated settings and the tools that they use to reflect upon the future; the second how digital tools might be used to enhance students' understanding of the city as a site of change, in this instance, climate change; and the third how such agency might be developed collectively in partnership with other city dwellers. We conclude that a diversity of students' engagement in urban contexts of learning offers ways from which to further investigate how identity, setting, and stakeholder relationships matter as part of potentially sustainable agentive learning futures.},

More recently the focus have shifted to lagging growth rates in Europe. The Lisbon strategy reflects these concerns by calling for reforms that ease market access, promote flexible labor markets, and simplify taxes and market regulation. The principal purpose of this paper is to build a simple model in which the possible effects of payroll taxes and employment protection policies on both unemployment and growth can be studied. The model is constructed of off the shelf parts found in the literatures on equilibrium unemployment and endogenous growth of the Schumpeterian variety. The model identifies channels though which both taxes and employment protection mandates can adversely affect growth though innovation. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the European Economic Association.},

  abstract = {The image of the city as a stressful place is an evergreen topic. In this article we review the imagination of urban stress, starting from Simmel's classic thesis that the modern city is an unavoidably psychic-stimulating environment potentially leading to stimuli overload. City dwellers are then supposed to counter stimuli overload with a series of adaptation strategies. However, the ways in which these phenomena can be conceptualised are varied. Historically, a shift of emphasis seems to have occurred from the classic conceptualisation of hyperaesthesia to the contemporary preoccupations with the design of comfortable atmospheres. Such atmospheres are, in fact, comfort bubbles. In the article, we tackle the aspirations and predicaments of such engineered atmospheres. In particular, we build on Sloterdijk's argument that, ultimately, bubbles fail to do away with stress, whereas for Simmel stress anaesthetised urbanites, Sloterdijk has pointed out that, rather, comfort itself stresses them. To better tackle the magmatic stratum of dissatisfaction that seems so coessential to urban life, in the final part of the article we focus on the notion of animosity. We suggest to conceptualise it as a type of disquiet that cannot be reduced to established recognisable interaction formats.},

Agents receive initial private information and select an action out of a choice set under uncertainty in each of infinitely many periods, observing the history of choices of their neighbors. Choices are made based on a common behavioral rule. Conditions under which rational learning leads to global consensus, local indifference and local disagreement are characterized. In the general setting considered, rational learning can lead to pairs of neighbors selecting different actions once learning ends, while not being indifferent among their choices. The effect of the network structure on the degree of information aggregation and speed of convergence is also considered and an answer to the question of optimal information aggregation in networks provided. The results highlight distinguishing features between properties of Bayesian and non-Bayesian learning in social networks.},

A peculiar characteristic of the Indian economy is that the unorganised nonfarm sector accounts for 43.2\% of NDP and employs 71.6\% of the total workforce. I analyse National Sample Survey data that covers over 4.4 million firms, in both unorganised sectors {\textendash} manufacturing and services. The empirical analysis is carried out using count models, and I instrument with land revenue institutions to deal with possible endogeneity bias. I find that buyer-suppler linkages and industrial diversity make a district more attractive to economic activity, whilst the quality and level of infrastructure are also important. I conclude that public policy may be limited in its ability to encourage relocation of informal firms.},

  abstract = {The built environment exerts great pressure on natural resources. Its role in the transition to a circular economy (CE) is critical. However, research from a holistic perspective, including how new business models can enable materials to increase their residual values, need to be deepened. This study provides a comprehensive and holistic overview of how the built environment approaches the study and the actions of the circular economy. Through a systematic literature review, 318 papers were selected and evaluated by two optics: i) a descriptive analysis and ii) a thematic analysis. The descriptive analysis highlights the relevance and incipient nature of circular thinking, the qualitative nature of the research, and the predominance of European countries and China at the forefront of circular research. In the thematic analysis, five axes were established as guiding lines of research, which evidenced the focus of research on minimizing and reusing construction and demolition waste. This study aims to provide the state of the art on CE research through a literature review. The results show research gaps and a theoretical framework was proposed to guide future research. The need for more explanations about CE and circular business models is highlighted, as well as greater integration between stakeholders in the construction value chain. Government support, such as subsidies, laws and tax incentives, is crucial to the strategic performance of decision-makers to introduce circular principles and make buildings and the built environment more sustainable.},

Using jobs as a proxy indicator, these measure gives cities a robust number to indicate progress toward the circular economy and is designed to serve as a first step in developing a circular economy strategy. The CE jobs measure tracks the inputs and outputs of goods in a city's ``boundaries'' through the material import dependency of the city's economic sectors. At the same time, tracking and assessing the circularity of the local jobs in these economic sectors will also provide city leaders with an indication of which sectors circularity is happening and could potentially happen. This paper also concludes that the process of coming to the CE jobs has two parts, the first more relevant to the local government and the second better influenced by the national government. Both need to come together for a truly circular local economy to happen.},

The methodology for analyzing the consumer behavior are the models of discrete choice based on the Theory of Random Utility. These models are based on the definition of preferences through a utility function that is maximized. These models also denominated of disaggregated demand derived from the decision of a set of individuals, who are formalized by the application of probabilistic models. The objective of this study is to determine the behavior of the consumer in the choice of a service, namely of transport services and in a short-distance corridor, such as Toledo-Madrid. The Toledo-Madrid corridor is characterized by being short distance, with high speed train available within the choice options to get the airport, along with the bus and the car. And where offers of HST and aircraft services can be proposed as complementary modes. By applying disaggregated transport models with revealed preference survey data and declared preferences, one can determine the most important variables involved in the choice and determine the arrangements for payment of individuals. These payment provisions may condition the use of certain transport policies to promote the use of efficient transportation.},

  abstract = {A key global challenge of the United Nations' 2015 Paris Agreement is to constrain global warming to 1.5{\textdegree}C. This critique of the `Buildings Breakthrough' agenda draws on existing literature and asks whether a technological approach to limiting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the built environment is adequate to meet the Agreement's objectives. Efforts to reduce emissions within this sector have focused upon clean technology (cleantech), e.g. clean energy, efficiency and circularity. Could sufficiency policies with a demand-side perspective have a significant role? Although the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) emphasised that the aggressive and immediate introduction of sufficiency policies was necessary to attain the Agreement, the importance of sufficiency in constraining growth of the building stock and (per capita) floor area is not yet part of the policy mix. Such policies are urgently needed to complement cleantech approaches, which form the focus of the so-called `Breakthrough Agenda'. The implication for the construction sector in the Global North is a shift away from new build toward long-term stewardship and adaptation of the built environment. For the Global South, growth of the built environment is needed to accommodate population growth and urbanisation, but requires an approach emphasising sufficiency in space, services and accessibility.},

Principal examples include enterprise zones, European Union Structural Funds, and industrial cluster policies. Place-based policies are rationalized by various hypotheses in urban and labor economics, such as agglomeration economies and spatial mismatch-hypotheses that entail market failures and often predict overlap between poor economic performance and disadvantaged residents. The evidence on enterprise zones is very mixed. We need to know more about what features of enterprise zone policies make them more effective or less effective, who gains and who loses from these policies, and how we can reconcile the existing findings. Some evidence points to positive benefits of infrastructure expenditure and also investment in higher education and university research-likely because of the public-goods nature of these policies. However, to better guide policy, we need to know more about what policies create self-sustaining longer run gains.},

  abstract = {The 2020 collapse of the global economy due to the Covid-19 pandemic has enabled us to think about long term trends and what the future could hold for our cities and regions, especially due to the climate agenda. The paper sets out the historical precedents for economic transitions after collapses that unleash new technologically based innovation waves. These are shown to be associated with different energy and infrastructure priorities and their transport and resulting urban forms. The new technologies in the past were emerging but mainstreamed as the new economy was built on new investments. The paper suggests that the new economy, for the next 30 years, is likely to be driven by the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) agendas (summarised as zero carbon{\textendash}zero poverty) and will have a strong base in a cluster of innovative technologies: renewable energy, electromobility, smart cities, hydrogen-based industry, circular economy technologies, and biophilic urbanism. The first three are well underway, and the other three will need interventions if not cultural changes and may miss being mainstreamed in this recovery but could still play a minor role in the new economy. The resulting urban transformations are likely to build on Covid-19 through ``global localism'' and could lead to five new features: (1) relocalised centres with distributed infrastructure, (2) tailored innovations in each urban fabric, (3) less car dependence, (4) symbiotic partnerships for funding, and (5) rewritten manuals for urban professionals. This period needs human creativity to play a role in revitalising the human dimension of cities. The next wave following this may be more about regenerative development.},

  abstract = {Monthly and weekly economic indicators are often taken to be the largest common factor estimated from high and low frequency data, either separately or jointly. To incorporate mixed frequency information without directly modeling them, we target a low frequency diffusion index that is already available, and treat high frequency values as missing. We impute these values using multiple factors estimated from the high frequency data. In the empirical examples considered, static matrix completion that does not account for serial correlation in the idiosyncratic errors yields imprecise estimates of the missing values irrespective of how the factors are estimated. Single equation and systems-based dynamic procedures that account for serial correlation yield imputed values that are closer to the observed low frequency ones. This is the case in the counterfactual exercise that imputes the monthly values of consumer sentiment series before 1978 when the data was released only on a quarterly basis. This is also the case for a weekly version of the CFNAI index of economic activity that is imputed using seasonally unadjusted data. The imputed series reveals episodes of increased variability of weekly economic information that are masked by the monthly data, notably around the 2014-15 collapse in oil prices.},

  abstract = {Urban metabolism studies have been established for only a few cities worldwide, and difficulties obtaining adequate statistical data are universal. Constraints and peculiarities call for innovative methods to quantify the materials entering and leaving city boundaries. Such methods include the extrapolation of data at the country or the region level based, namely, on sales, population, commuters, workers, and waste produced. The work described in this article offers a new methodology developed specifically for quantifying urban material flows, making possible the regular compilation of data pertinent to the characterization of a city's metabolism. This methodology was tested in a case study that characterized the urban metabolism of the city of Lisbon by quantifying Lisbon's material balance for 2004. With this aim, four variables were characterized and linked to material flows associated with the city: absolute consumption of materials/products per category, throughput of materials in the urban system per material category material intensity of economic activities, and waste flows per treatment technology. Results show that annual material consumption in Lisbon totals 11.223 million tonnes (20 tonnes per capita), and material outputs sum 2.149 million tonnes. Nonrenewable resources represent almost 80\% of the total material consumption, and renewables consumption (biomass) constitutes only 18\% of the total consumption. The remaining portion is made up of nonspecified materials. A seemingly excessive consumption amount of nonrenew- able materials compared to renewables may be the result of a large investment in building construction and a significant shift toward private car traveling, to the detriment of public transportation. {\textcopyright} 2009 by Yale University.},

We propose an internet auction model, in which very late bids have a positive probability of not being successfully submitted, and show that late bidding in a fixed deadline auction can occur at equilibrium in auctions both with private values and with uncertain, dependent values. Late bidding may also arise out of equilibrium, as a best reply to incremental bidding. However, the strategic advantages of late bidding are severely attenuated in auctions that apply an automatic extension rule such as auctions conducted on Amazon. Field data show that there is more late bidding on eBay than on Amazon, and this difference grows with experience. We also study the incidence of multiple bidding, and its relation to late bidding. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We propose a method to establish which municipalities should be considered part of a metropolitan area based on labour market integration. In order to aggregate geographically proximate urban municipalities, we develop a network-based model that makes industry productivity (manifesting in formal employment creation) dependent on firms' ability to find, within city limits, the diversity of skills they need to move to new complex industries. In this way, we uncover the natural city scale at which firms optimally exploit the range of skills available to them within a broad catchment area. Considering Colombian cities, we find that commuting times between 45 and 75 min, corresponding to between 43 and 62 distinct cities or integrated labour markets, allow firms to maximise formal employment creation (between 2008 and 2013). This result supports the development of passenger transport limiting commuting times within cities, connecting small- and mid-size cities to nearby large cities, and coordinating transportation investments across traditional administrative boundaries.},

Its national economy is already concentrated in cities: almost 65\% of China's GDP was produced in its 53 metropolitan regions in 2004. Although the scale of China's urbanisation - and the growing number of metropolitan regions within which this urbanisation is concentrating - is unprecedented globally, issues confronting all levels of government in managing this growth are not unique. Most OECD countries have needed to address a wide range of urban management challenges, and are continuing to acquire valuable experience in doing so. Among the key challenges that many countries have been confronted with include: How to maximise national benefits of urbanisation and mitigating its negative impacts? What are the economic, social, and environmental costs of meeting these challenges? How to define the most effective and efficient allocation of functional responsibilities among various levels of government in the urban context? How to effectively plan urban development in a market context? This report presents an overview of trends in urban policies in OECD countries with the objective to identify successes and failure that could inform national Chinese policy-makers in their preparation of an Urbanisation Strategy.},

The world is in the middle of an urbanisation process that will cause urbanisation rates to rise from low double digit rates to more than 80\% by the end of the century. It argues that this is both a great opportunity and a great challenge, as decisions taken today will affect the lifes of people for a long time to come. The report aims at explaining why cities exist, and what can make them prosperous and function well. It also discusses whether cities are good for residents, for the countries they are located in and for the global environment. The report argues that cities exist and grow because they are a source of economic prosperity and offer amenities that benefit their residents. It concludes that urbanisation is a process that needs to be shaped by policy makers to ensure that all benefit from it.

The economics of crime has several points of contact with the economics of space, since the commission of an index crime requires proximity between offenders and victims (or their property). We explore these linkages, as well as a range of other issues: the effects of certainty and severity of punishment on crime; the role of stereotypes in interactions between offenders, victims, and law enforcement officers; and racial disparities in victimization, offending, and incarceration. The economics of crime has made tremendous progress, but enormous variation across both time and space remains poorly understood, and many nontraditional explanations often neglected by economists need to be explored more systematically.},

  abstract = {Crime is a major threat to society's well-being but lacks a statistical characterization that could lead to uncovering some of its underlying mechanisms. Evidence of nonlinear scaling of urban indicators in cities, such as wages and serious crime, has motivated the understanding of cities as complex systems - a perspective that offers insights into resources limits and sustainability, but that usually neglects details of the indicators themselves. Notably, since the nineteenth century, criminal activities have been known to occur unevenly within a city; crime concentrates in such way that most of the offenses take place in few regions of the city. Though confirmed by different studies, this concentration lacks broad analyses on its characteristics, which hinders not only the comprehension of crime dynamics but also the proposal of sounding counter-measures. Here, we developed a framework to characterize crime concentration which divides cities into regions with the same population size. We used disaggregated criminal data from 25 locations in the U.S. and the U.K., spanning from 2 to 15 years of longitudinal data. Our results confirmed that crime concentrates regardless of city and revealed that the level of concentration does not scale with city size. We found that the distribution of crime in a city can be approximated by a power-law distribution with exponent {$\alpha$} that depends on the type of crime. In particular, our results showed that thefts tend to concentrate more than robberies, and robberies more than burglaries. Though criminal activities present regularities of concentration, we found that criminal ranks have the tendency to change continuously over time - features that support the perspective of crime as a complex system and demand analyses and evolving urban policies covering the city as a whole.},

  abstract = {Many environmental scientists are analysing spatial data by geostatistical methods and interpolating from sparse sample data by kriging to make maps. They recognize its merits in providing unbiased estimates with minimum variance. Several statistical packages now have the facilities they require, as do some geographic information systems. In the latter kriging is an option for interpolation that can be done at the press of a few buttons. Unfortunately, the ease conferred by this allows one to krige without understanding and to produce unreliable and even misleading results. Crucial for sound kriging is a plausible function for the spatial covariances or, more widely, of the variogram. The variogram must be estimated reliably and then modelled with valid mathematical functions. This requires an understanding of the assumptions in the underlying theory of random processes on which geostatistics is based. Here we guide readers through computing the sample variogram and modelling it by weighted least-squares fitting. We explain how to choose the most suitable functions by a combination of graphics and statistical diagnostics. Ordinary kriging follows straightforwardly from the model, but small changes in the model function and its parameters can affect the kriging error variances. When kriging is automated these effects remain unknown. We explain the choices to be made when kriging, i.e. whether the support is at points or over blocks, and whether the predictions are global or within moving windows. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an agent-based 'monocentric' model: assuming only a fixed location for firms, outcomes closely parallel those found in classical urban economic models, but emerge through 'bottom-up' interaction in an agent-based model. Agents make buying and movement decisions based on a set of simple costs they face from their current location. These spatial costs are reduced to two types: the costs of moving people and goods across geographical distances and the costs (and benefits) of 'being here' (the effects of being at a particular location such as land costs, amenities or disamenities). Two approaches to land cost are compared: landlords and a 'density cost' proxy. Emergent equilibrium outcomes are found to depend on the interaction of externalities and time. These findings are produced by looking at how agents react to changing four types of cost, two spatial and two non-spatial: commuting, wage, good cost and good delivery. The models explore equilibrium outcomes, the effect of changing costs and the impact of heterogeneous agents, before focusing in on one example to find the source of emergence in the externalities of agent choice. The paper finishes by emphasising the importance of thinking about emergence as a tool, not an end in itself.},

  abstract = {Cities are increasingly the fundamental socio-economic units of human societies worldwide, but we still lack a unified characterization of urbanization that captures the social processes realized by cities across time and space. This is especially important for understanding the role of cities in the history of human civilization and for determining whether studies of ancient cities are relevant for contemporary science and policy. As a step in this direction, we develop a theory of settlement scaling in archaeology, deriving the relationship between population and settled area from a consideration of the interplay between social and infrastructural networks. We then test these models on settlement data from the Pre-Hispanic Basin of Mexico to show that this ancient settlement system displays spatial scaling properties analogous to those observed in modern cities. Our data derive from over 1,500 settlements occupied over two millennia and spanning four major cultural periods characterized by different levels of agricultural productivity, political centralization and market development. We show that, in agreement with theory, total settlement area increases with population size, on average, according to a scale invariant relation with an exponent in the range 2/3{$\leq\alpha\leq$}5/6. As a consequence, we are able to infer aggregate socioeconomic properties of ancient societies from archaeological measures of settlement organization. Our findings, from an urban settlement system that evolved independently from its old-world counterparts, suggest that principles of settlement organization are very general and may apply to the entire range of human history. {\textcopyright} 2014 Ortman et al.},

It attempts to relate the issues to some of the themes of the conference: policy making, architectural design and urban principles, socioeconomic concerns, environmental, social and cultural sustainability and affordability. While South Africa has had success in the rapid delivery of houses, it has been acknowledged that there are still many challenges faced in terms of generating functioning neighbourhoods as opposed to house units. Considering the complex political history of the country, as well as current challenges of crime and poverty, may allow for shared lessons with the context of Sudan, while issues of reconciliation and closing the gaps between the rich and the poor are similar. Further, dealing with the peripheries of cities is a shared concern. Debating environmental degradation, disconnected and uncoordinated developments could also allow for dialogue. Both South Africa and Sudan need to learn from the vernacular and informality. They need to develop a distinctive approach to housing that relates to unique local concerns, as well as debate how these concerns relate to international knowledge and paradigms. South Africas concern with crime is in a way comparable to Sudans concerns with political instability and dealing with the disruption caused by wars. The difficulties of dealing with racism, poverty and social exclusion are also comparable. This paper attempts to portray some of the issues in the hope that a debate may be initiated as to how professionals can learn from each other and whether collaboration may be possible. At a meeting in 2005, and on finding out that one of the authors is from the Sudan, the current Minister of Housing Lindiwe Sisulu said with enthusiasm: When we have solved the housing problem here, we will then go and solve it in Sudan!},

  abstract = {Peaks and troughs in the spatial distributions of population, employment and wealth are a universal phenomenon in search of a general theory. Such spatial imbalances have two possible explanations. In the first one, uneven economic development can be seen as the result of the uneven distribution of natural resources. This is sometimes called 'first nature' and refers to exogenously given characteristics of different sites. However, it falls short of providing a reasonable explanation of many other clusters of activities, which are much less dependent on natural advantage. The aim of geographical economics is precisely to understand what are the economic forces that, after controlling for first nature, account for 'second nature', which emerges as the outcome of human beings' actions to improve upon the first one. Specifically, geographical economics asks what are the economic forces that can sustain a large permanent imbalance in the distribution of economic activities. In this paper, we focus on the so-called 'new economic geography' approach. After having described some of the main results developed in standard location theory, we use a unified framework to survey the home market effect as well as core-periphery models. These models have been criticized by geographers because they account for some spatial costs while putting others aside without saying why. Furthermore, core-periphery models also exhibit some extreme features that are reflected in their bang-bang outcomes. We thus move on by investigating what the outcomes of core-periphery models become when we account for a more complete and richer description of the spatial aspects that these models aim at describing. We conclude by suggesting new lines of research. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Some paradoxes are identified using mixed methodologies from a qualitative research design. Lagos's northwards expansion has exerted several externalities on a neighbouring state. Expansion within Lagos, on its coastal south-eastern axis, is defined by real estate activities of a different nature. In both cases, new settlements have emerged with differing social and economic characteristics that have far-reaching impact for housing accessibility and affordability. These differences are explored by establishing pull-factors responsible for attracting specific income groups to each axis, the impact of government action (and inaction), and the implications of these for city growth and management. Formal mechanisms of planning lead to a proliferation of higher end real estate development. This has created unequal access to land and housing for lower income families. The subsequent exclusion of lower income families from planned areas represents a failure of the market system. Lagos presents compelling complexities of the management of urban expansion that spread beyond administrative boundaries, as well as the influence of planning to achieve economic development.},

An econometric analysis using household survey data from India for the year 1993-1994 reveals that household socio-economic, demographic, geographic, family and dwelling attributes influence the total household energy requirements. There are also large variations in the pattern of energy requirements across households belonging to different expenditure classes. Results from the econometric estimation show that total household expenditure or income level is the most important explanatory variable causing variation in energy requirements across households. In addition, the size of the household dwelling and the age of the head of the household are related to higher household energy requirements. In contrast, the number of members in the household and literacy of the head are associated with lower household energy requirements. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Ramaswami. The message of the paper, which set in trail a number of publications, was that in the case of a small open economy, distortions that steer the economy away from Pareto-optimal outcomes should be dealt with at their source. The Bhagwati and Ramaswami paper established the case for free trade in the presence of domestic distortions, and proved wrong the received wisdom of the day that in the presence of distortions such as externalities, wage rigidities and distorted factor and product markets, a move from free trade to autarky might improve welfare. The article succinctly demonstrated that the correct policy intervention which avoided welfare losses was one which rectified a distortion at its source and is justly regarded as a classic. But in the profession of economics those who question received wisdom are regarded with scepticism at first and then with the riposte that it is all old wine served in new bottles. The Bhagwati-Ramaswami breakthrough was met with the remark 'it is all in Meade'. This paper takes issue with this judgement. The paper not only refutes the suggestion that the Bhagwati-Ramaswami article has its origins in Meade but also provides a lucid and succinct exposition of Meade's analysis of divergences and shows how Bhagwati and Ramaswami's analysis is vastly different. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Author Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Moreover, the decline in poverty rates during these years has been sharper for the socially disadvantaged groups relative to upper caste groups so that we now observe a narrowing of the gap in the poverty rates between the two sets of social groups.

We show that even if all individual agents have a strict preference for perfect integration, best-response dynamics may lead to segregation. This raises some doubts on the ability of public policies to generate integration through the promotion of openness and tolerance with respect to diversity.

  abstract = {Significance             We find that urban infrastructure inequalities are a characteristic feature of urbanization, with multiscale patterns that highlight greater inequalities at regional than at local intracity scales. Results show that the level of urban infrastructure inequality has a significant bearing on urbanization characteristics. Owing to infrastructure inequalities, urbanization as a pathway to sustainable development faces fundamental constraints. Our study raises intriguing questions about the urban infrastructure inequality implications of future urbanization and the spatial scales at which we ought to understand and address these inequalities.           ,              Urbanization can challenge sustainable development if it produces unequal outcomes. Infrastructure is an important urbanization dimension, providing services to support diverse urban activities. However, it can lock in unequal outcomes due to its durable nature. This paper studies inequalities in infrastructure distributions to derive insights into the structure and characteristics of unequal outcomes associated with urbanization. We analyzed infrastructure inequalities in two emerging economies in the Global South: India and South Africa. We developed and applied an inequality measure to understand the structure of inequality in infrastructure provisioning (based on census data) and infrastructure availability (based on satellite nighttime lights [NTLs] data). Consistent with differences in economic inequality, results show greater inequalities in South Africa than in India and greater urban inequalities than rural inequalities. Nevertheless, inequalities in urban infrastructure provisioning and infrastructure availability increase from finer to coarser spatial scales. NTL-based inequality measurements additionally show that inequalities are more concentrated at coarse spatial scales in India than in South Africa. Finally, results show that urban inequalities in infrastructure provisioning covary with urbanization levels conceptualized as a multidimensional phenomenon, including demographic, economic, and infrastructural dimensions. Similarly, inequalities in urban infrastructure availability increase monotonically with infrastructure development levels and urban population size. Together, these findings underscore infrastructure inequalities as a feature of urbanization and suggest that understanding urban inequalities requires applying an inequality lens to urbanization.},

The failure to consider such distribution implies that, holding income constant, different spatial patterns provide the same inequality measure. This property is referred to as anonymity and presents an interesting question about the relationship between inequality and space. Particularly, spatial dependence could play an important role in shaping the geographical distribution of income and could be usefully incorporated into inequality measures. Following this idea, this paper introduces a new measure that facilitates the assessment of the relative contribution of spatial patterns to overall inequality. The proposed index is based on the Gini correlation measure and accounts for both inequality and spatial autocorrelation. Unlike most of the spatially based income inequality measures proposed in the literature, our index introduces regional importance weighting in the analysis, thereby differentiating the regional contributions to overall inequality. Starting with the proposed measure, a spatial decomposition of the Gini index of inequality for weighted data is also derived. This decomposition permits the identification of the actual extent of regional disparities and the understanding of the interdependences among regional economies. The proposed measure is illustrated by an empirical analysis focused on Italian provinces.},

We show that the resulting geo-industrial clusters exhibit a stronger association between the influx of educated workers and financial performance, compared to traditional aggregation units. Furthermore, our analysis of the skills of educated workers reveals richer insights into the relationship between the labor flow of educated workers and productivity growth. We argue that geo-industrial clusters defined by labor flow provide useful insights into the growth of the economy.},

The urbanization of poverty also underscores the imperative of downscaling the emerging debate about the developmental state to the city scale. The arguments in this article start from the proposition that a universal rights agenda can and should be fulfilled as an alternative to neoliberal aspirations, and that to achieve this development action will be needed on a series of different scales. The article is structured in three main parts. The first section explores the implications for the state of adopting a rights-based agenda in the urban context, giving particular emphasis to defining those rights whose meaning arises from settlement planning or management-based policies and interventions on the individual, household, neighbourhood and more macro-environmental scale (what we call 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation rights or the 'right to the city'). The second part of the article is dedicated to illustrating the particular nature of how rights to the city are blocked or achieved, using the experiences of the Greater Cape Town area. The final section of the article makes a more general case for a more radical rights-based agenda for cities. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

  abstract = {The demographic transition of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has shifted the locus of urbanizing populations from the global North to the global South. As the theoretical epicenter of urban scholars and policymakers adjusts to accommodate this transition, some realignment in how ideas are weighted and applied is inevitable. This recalibration, while not necessarily comfortable for those in established positions of intellectual power, is desirable and maybe even overdue. The overarching argument presented here is that recent work on neoliberalism, despite its quality and relevance for many places, will need to be "provincialized" in order to create intellectual space for alternative ideas that may be more relevant to cities where the majority of the world's urban population now resides. To this end, we explore the limits to the critique of neoliberalism-a perspective that has assumed hegemonic dimensions in the progressive geographical literature. In seeking post-neoliberal insights, we highlight two bodies of work that also address issues of urban injustice. The first is the largely practice-generated literature on poverty and its amalgamation into a resurgent literature focused on the right to the city. The second theoretical framework we explore as a counterpoint to the neoliberal crtitique is the nascent debate about the size and shape of the subnational state, arguing that it is time to bring to the fore the difficult question concerning the most appropriate form of urban government. Finally, we suggest that if the state is to be an important component in the urban developmental landscape, all sorts of initiatives in research and capacity-building will be needed, giving substantially greater attention to documenting urban change on hitherto under-researched cities, and learning from practice how to transform the theoretical canon to ensure 21st-century relevance.},

The New Urban Agenda, currently under debate, is located in its historical context to reveal who the major actors and institutions were that defined global urban policy; what the shifting normative positions on cities are; and why the increasingly complex process of the global policy environment makes defining a universal agreement on urban development so hard. At stake in UN negotiations are fundamental issues about the centrality of urban pathways to sustainable development. A historical view of the Habitat process reveals that even at the global scale it is possible for those with strong convictions to change the normative base and mode of working on urban issues, but that the compromise politics of the international system also masks important compromises and contradictions. Looking back over the decades of international debate on development priorities shows not only that there is now greater acceptance of the importance of defining and agreeing to "an urban agenda" but that global policy on urban and regional issues has indeed evolved. There is no longer a question of whether cities are important for sustainable development, but rather why and how the urban condition affects our common future.},

  abstract = {The reshaping of South African cities is being guided by policies aiming to build socially and environmentally just communities. Despite widespread commitment to this goal, there is little consensus on what it means and how it should and could translate into practice. The paper shows that despite the emphasis on environmental justice and building sustainable communities in policy, the institutional context for implementation (including expert driven and deliberative approaches) do not always deliver on this mandate. Consequently, policy outcomes do not reflect those of the communities and households it is meant to serve, raising challenging moral and ethical questions for institutions involved in environmental governance. This paper shows how the institutional context of environmental assessment combined with the role played by the values held by environmental practitioners charged with influencing decision-making result in the perpetuation of environmental injustices. The lack of a clearly defined profession and professional body, reflecting a diversity of values, debating, regulating, defining and defending a set of principles to guide decision-making in cities is identified as a possible reason for the lack of congruence between the values reflected in policy with those held by the communities these interventions are intended to serve. The resulting value added by sustainable cities interventions in the light of this mismatch is therefore questionable, raising challenges regarding international calls for local action as well as an increasing policy focus in South Africa on the local level as the agent of political and spatial transformation of cities. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present a new form of chart, which clarifies the inter-relationships between six fundamental urban design parameters that affect the quality and character of any urban layout. These parameters are: built-up area per capita; public ground area per capita (which includes streets and parks); plot factor (the ratio of land area given over to private development to land area available for public use, including that needed for circulation and area available for sport, recreation and public amenities (schools, hospitals, public toilets); floor space index (ratio of built-up area to buildable plot area); net density (population divided by the sum of all buildable plot areas); and gross density (population divided by total area). Mapping these six parameters in a chart shows the complicated trade-offs between one desirable feature and another, including combinations that show that higher densities do not necessarily mean small accommodation and inadequate public space - but they do mean high-rise, and there are severe limits on how high densities can go. The paper also plots diagrams that show the values of these parameters for existing localities in New York, Mumbai (including Dharavi) and Delhi. These diagrams are examples. With more data and more diagrams we might reach a better understanding of what particular values or combinations of values for these parameters we should aim for when designing a new development or modifying an old one. We might also understand the values or combinations of values that we should avoid. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED).},

Then, assuming cross-subsidized differential pricing of land for different income groups, we determine the financial viability of any particular site. Two specific sites in northern Mumbai are studied for their implementation problems. But the proposal is generic, and with altered assumptions could be applied internationally wherever the context allows.},

While there exists a significant body of empirical studies documenting these effects, theoretical developments have lagged this empirical work and in particular, microeconomic time allocation models have not to date been fully extended to accommodate the implications of an increasingly digitised society. To address this gap, we present a modelling framework, grounded in time allocation theories and the goods-leisure framework, for joint modelling of the choice of mode of activity (physical versus tele-activity), travel mode and route, and ICT bundle. By providing the expression for a conditional indirect utility function, we use hypothetical scenarios to demonstrate how our framework can conceptualise various activity-travel decision situations. In our scenarios we assume a variety of situations such as the implications of severe weather, the introduction of autonomous vehicles, and the interaction between multiple decision makers. Moreover, our approach lays the microeconomic foundations for deriving subjective values of ICT qualities such as broadband speed or connection reliability. Finally, we also demonstrate the means by which our framework could be linked to various data collection protocols (stated preference exercises, diaries of social interactions, laboratory experiments) and modelling approaches (discrete choice modelling, hazard-based duration models).},

This model was designed for the United Nations Development Programme as a building stone of the Disaster Risk Index (DRI), which aims at monitoring the evolution of risk. Assessing what countries are most at risk requires considering various types of hazards, such as droughts, floods, cyclones and earthquakes. Before assessing risk, these four hazards were modelled using GIS and overlaid with a model of population distribution in order to extract human exposure. Human vulnerability was measured by crossing exposure with selected socio-economic parameters. The model evaluates to what extent observed past losses are related to population exposure and vulnerability. Results reveal that human vulnerability is mostly linked with country development level and environmental quality. A classification of countries is provided, as well as recommendationson data improvement for future use of the model. {\textcopyright} Author(s) 2009.},

  abstract = {The use of satellite imagery, particularly night-time lights, has flourished in the last 20 years for socioeconomic studies. The intensity of the lights captured through remote sensing is frequently used as a proxy of different socioeconomic indicators. While some studies found a high correla\- tion between night-time lights intensity and Gross Domestic Product, there has been an incon\- clusive debate about the validity of this assumption that night-time lights can serve as a good proxy for the economic development to sub-national level studies, particularly in rural areas of middle and lowincome countries. We test the suitability of night-time lights from publicly available data sources for estimating Regional Domestic Product (RDP) across municipalities with different degrees of urbanization in Colombia. We use a series of cross-sectional regression models to compare correlation between municipality RDP and luminosity from different sources for 2012 (DMSP, VIIRS, harmonized DMSP/VIIRS, and harmonized DMSP/VIIRS masked with Global Urban Footprint), as well as multilevel regression models to estimate RDP time-series from 2011 to 2018. Our findings reveal that all compared night-time light products can serve as a good indicator of municipal RDP patterns, while VIIRS data presents the best model fit. Harmonized data that have extensive temporal night-time light records from 2011 to 2018 were significantly correlated with RDP time-series. For seven population size levels {\textendash} from big cities ({$>$}500,000 inhabitants) to rural areas ({$<$}5,000 inhabitants), the results present a comparatively higher model fit for urban than rural areas. The use of Global Urban Footprint further improved model fit for large cities but worsened rural RDP estimates. Therefore, our analysis underscores that the use of night-time lights can be a very valuable method to estimate patterns of socioeconomic change at the municipal level in medium and low-income countries and thus may help to implement better sustainability-oriented policies.},

To investigate the extent of Indian urbanisation, this article develops a multi-step methodology using indicators specifically conceived for identifying urban structures in India. In this article, an emphasis is given to the conception and to the spatial analysis of two indicators: metropolitan ranking and meta-agglomerations. A method combining these indicators then allows identifying urban macro-structures acting as a larger organising framework in the regional space. Our results show a multitude of different functional areas that have developed specific urban morphologies over time. Some are particularly marked by high values of urban macrocephaly, small settlements taking the shape of nebulae, urban sprawl, etc.},

While immigration policies are typically national, the effects of international migrants are often more easily identified on local economies. The reason is that their settlements are significantly concentrated across cities and regions, relative to natives. Immigrants are different from natives in several economically relevant skills. Their impact on the local economy depends on these skills. We emphasize that to evaluate correctly such impact, we also need to understand and measure the local adjustments produced by the immigrant flow. Workers and firms take advantage of the opportunities brought by immigrants and respond to them trying to maximize their welfare. We present a common conceptual frame to organize our analysis of the local effects of immigration, and we describe several applications. We then discuss the empirical literature that has tried to isolate and identify a causal impact of immigrants on the local economies and to estimate the different margins of response and the resulting outcomes for natives of different skill types. We finally survey promising recent avenues for advancing this research.},

  abstract = {This paper contributes to the theoretical research exploring the interface between comparative advantage (locational fundamentals) and agglomeration economies. A simple model is developed which highlights costly trade of final outputs and of intermediates. We derive the novel insight that the interaction between comparative advantage and agglomeration economies involves a fundamental tension which is intricately affected by trade costs. A reduction of trade costs fosters the dispersive impact of comparative advantage in sectors governed by this force whilst the impact of agglomeration economies is enhanced by a fall in trade costs in industries where increasing returns prevail. The key implication for international trade is that the relative wage between large and small economies is not only shaped by the primitive determinants of agglomeration economies and comparative advantage but also, in a different way, by trade costs. The key implication for an economic geography setting where labor is mobile is that partial agglomeration emerges when agglomeration economies are strong relative to comparative advantage, and this is more likely when trade costs are lower (higher) in industries governed by increasing returns (comparative advantage). The model provides a foundation for an urban system in which the larger city exhibits more diversity in production.},

Using panel microdata collected between 2008 and 2014, it exploits the arbitrary eligibility rules of the policy with a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to obtain reduced form estimates. There are three main findings. First, in the short-term of 2 to 4 years following relocation, the labor supply of recipient households decreases, driven mostly by a reduction of female hours. Second, the large increase in distance (km) to economic opportunities seems to be an important factor behind the decline, directly or indirectly through family shifts in earning strategies. Finally, evidence is limited regarding improvements in housing and neighborhood quality. Overall, there is no clear indication that the net welfare effect of relocation is positive.},

  address = {{New Delhi}},
  institution = {{Planning Commission, Government of India}},
  abstract = {Preface Growth is not the sole objective of economic policy. It is necessary to ensure that the benefits of growth accrue to all sections of the society. Eradication of poverty is thus an important objective. Human beings need a certain minimum consumption of food and non-food items to survive. However the perception regarding what constitutes poverty varies over time and across countries. Nevertheless there is need for a measure of poverty. Only then, it will be possible to evaluate how the economy is performing in terms of providing a certain minimum standard of living to all its citizens. Measurement of Poverty has, therefore, important policy implications. In India we have had a long history of studies on measurement of poverty. There are in fact many approaches to it. Some analysts focus on deprivations. There are however many problems associated with this approach including difficulties in aggregating deprivations on several scores derived from different data sources. Perhaps the best approach is look at it in terms of a certain minimum consumption expenditure per person or preferably per household. Any household failing to meet this level of consumption expenditure can be treated as a poor household. This minimum level of consumption expenditure can be derived, in turn, in terms of minimum expenditure on food and non-food items. Minimum food consumption is related to fulfilling certain nutritional standards. However the minimum non-food consumption is more problematical. The Report explains how we went about it. Based on the analysis presented in the Report, monthly per capita consumption expenditure of Rs. 972 in rural areas and Rs. 1407 in urban areas is treated as the poverty line at the all India level. This implies a monthly consumption expenditure of Rs. 4860 in rural areas or Rs. 7035 in urban areas for a family of five at 2011-12 prices. This has to be seen in the context of public expenditure that is being incurred in areas like education, health and food security. The actual 'well-being' of the household will be higher than what is indicated by the poverty line. Based on the methodology outlined in the Report, the poverty ratio at all India level for 2011-12 comes to 29.5\%. Working backwards this methodology gives the estimate for 2009-2010 at 38.2\%. This is in contrast to 21.9\% as estimated by Tendulkar methodology for 2011-12 and 29.8\% for 2009-10.},

The rhetoric of the knowledge economy ideologues is very narrowly construed but at the same time politically powerful and, despite clearly documented effects of globalized capitalism such as massive deskilling, tremendous structural unemployment and vast (and rapidly growing) urban slums, the dominant economistic paradigms and power structures make critical reconsideration very difficult. Some adult educators, like those in Hume City, Australia, or of the Shikshantar Institute in Udaipur, India, who hold a wider, critical view of lifelong learning, are promoting the learning city not as an end but as a social process of participation and negotiation.},

However, current CE research tends to focus either on the macro-scale, such as eco-parks, or the micro-scale, such as manufactured products, with the risk of ignoring the additional impacts and potentials at the meso-scale of individual buildings. This article sets out to unpack the fundamental defining dimensions of a CE and frame them for CE studies for the built environment. A critical literature review forms the basis for identifying and framing such fundamental dimensions. Our contribution highlights the key roles of interdisciplinary research and of both bottom-up and top-down initiatives in facilitating the transition to `circular buildings'. The frame for reference has been used to capture current discourse on the sustainability of the built environment and has proved to be a valuable tool to cluster existing initiatives and highlight missing links for interdisciplinary endeavours. The article represents a contribution to the theoretical foundations of CE research in the built environment and a stepping stone to shape future research initiatives.},

  abstract = {Intra-urban distribution of different income groups of population is arguably a function of four major determinants: (a) overall income, (b) housing expenses, (c) commuting expenses and (d) other outlays, conditionally independent of a particular location. These factors are likely to cause a patched distribution of different population groups, with predominant concentration of low-income residents in inner-city fringes, along the major transport lines. The validity of this supposition is tested using statistical data available for the city of Be'er Sheva, Israel. Hierarchical cluster analysis is used to determine the underlying patterns of intra-urban inequalities at a neighbourhood level. A number of development strategies are proposed, aimed at reducing the extent of intra-urban development disparities. These include: (i) enhancing the development of inner-city fringes as a mean of facilitating intra-urban commuting; (ii) more even distribution of public housing construction across urban areas; and (iii) establishing a system of special-purpose grants, aimed at assisting low- and medium-income residents in either renting or purchasing apartments and houses outside inner-city suburbs. It is also suggested that the distribution of property tax burden should reflect the neighbourhoods' development and welfare of residents and not be based only on physical size and structural conditions of the building, as often reflected in current practice.},

We analyse the different stages of urbanization, identify what social and economic trends influence the spatial development of so-called Mega-City-Regions, and we investigate the impact of ICT on urban form. Finally, we determine what implications these urban regional dynamics have for multifunctional urban planning. We conclude that after a long period of a spatial separation of functions like housing, employment, recreation and transport in the industrialization period, we now are moving to a multifunctional area development. In urban areas more centres and sub-centres will be developed, which also function as nodes in transport infrastructures and ICT-networks. The integrated development of urban centres, infrastructure nodes, housing and business areas and green-blue networks, following the preferences of the citizens, is the most important challenge for urban planners of Mega-City-Regions.},

  abstract = {Human activity is organised around daily and weekly cycles, which should, in turn, dominate all types of social interactions, such as transactions, communications, gatherings and so on. Yet, despite their strategic importance for policing and security, cyclical weekly patterns in crime and road incidents have been unexplored at the city and neighbourhood level. Here we construct a novel method to capture the weekly trace, or "heartbeat" of events and use geotagged data capturing the time and location of more than 200,000 violent crimes and nearly one million crashes in Mexico City. On aggregate, our findings show that the heartbeats of crime and crashes follow a similar pattern. We observe valleys during the night and peaks in the evening, where the intensity during a peak is 7.5 times the intensity of valleys in terms of crime and 12.3 times in terms of road accidents. Although distinct types of events, crimes and crashes reach their respective intensity peak on Friday night and valley on Tuesday morning, the result of a hyper-synchronised society. Next, heartbeats are computed for city neighbourhood 'tiles', a division of space within the city based on the distance to Metro and other public transport stations. We find that heartbeats are spatially heterogeneous with some diffusion, so that nearby tiles have similar heartbeats. Tiles are then clustered based on the shape of their heartbeat, e.g., tiles within groups suffer peaks and valleys of crime or crashes at similar times during the week. The clusters found are similar to those based on economic activities. This enables us to anticipate temporal traces of crime and crashes based on local amenities.},

  abstract = {Towns and cities have expanded all over the world for more than eight thousands years The size of these permanent nodules of resident population ranges today from a few thousands to tens of millions inhabitants. The number of cities in a given territory is always in an inverse geometrical progression of their size (for instance, there are about 23 000 urban agglomerations larger than 10 000 inhabitants in the world, 2000 are larger than 100 000 inhabitants and about 200 above 1 million, after Moriconi-Ebrard, 1993). This persistent scaling behaviour has been questioned for more than one century, giving rise to a large variety of interpretations. Are the scaling effects observed in urban systems produced by the hierarchical organisation of societies? Are they generated by purely random processes, a mere product of laws of large numbers? Are they the possibly involuntary result of some not totally conscious social rules? Are they constrained by physical and/or social rules, according to some optimisation or ordering principles? Are they emergent properties linked with the historical process of urbanisation? Could they disappear after the end of the urban transition? As some of the answers that have been offered to these questions are highly contradictory, one might hope that a clarification could come from modelling and simulation, that can be very helpful tools for selecting among different hypothesis. On a theoretical level, urban theories, as in economics or sociology, could receive a better foundation by considering the geographical concept of ``system of cities''. These two research directions might also help improve the policies that are intended to control urban systems, by informing the urban governance at local and regional scales about ``spontaneous'' trends.},

Existing studies that explore the local patterning of disadvantage often construct composite indices that summarize the interactions between multiple dimensions of social status, but do not consider if, and how, disadvantage exhibits spatial structure. This study applies a Bayesian multivariate factor analytic modeling approach to examine the spatial structure of socioeconomic disadvantage in Toronto, Canada. Socioeconomic disadvantage is modeled as an area-based composite index associated with three variables measuring low income, low-educational attainment, and low occupational status, and a series of models with different assumptions regarding the spatial structure of disadvantage are compared. The best-fitting model shows that the prevalence of low-income households has the strongest positive association with disadvantage and that spatial clustering is three times more important than spatial heterogeneity for explaining the spatial structure of disadvantage. The implications of this study for analyzing multivariate spatial data and for understanding the interactions amongst multiple dimensions of disadvantage are discussed.},

Then, to any point in the city there corresponds a sequence of values for the variable, as one zooms out around the starting point, all the way up to the whole city {\textendash} as if with a varifocal camera lens. The sequences thus produced encode spatial dissimilarities in a precise manner: how much they differ from perfectly random sequences is indeed a signature of the underlying spatial structure. We introduce here a mathematical framework that allows to analyse this signature, and we provide a number of illustrative examples.},

A welfarist interpretation of global poverty lines is augmented by the idea of normative functionings, the cost of which varies across countries. In this light, current absolute measures are seen to ignore important social effects on welfare, while popular, strongly relative measures ignore absolute levels of living. It is argued that a new hybrid measure is called for, combining absolute and weakly relative measures consistent with how national lines vary across countries. Illustrative calculations indicate that we are seeing a falling incidence of poverty globally over the past 30 years. This is mainly due to lower absolute poverty counts in the developing world. While fewer people are poor by the global absolute standard, more are poor by the country-specific relative standard. The vast bulk of poverty, both absolute and relative, is now found in the developing world.},

In response, we demonstrate how a progressive understanding of ``senses'' of place that embraces fluid place meanings accessible at different temporal and spatial scales enables a new understanding of the interface between structural and emotional transformation of place, as well as rethinking of just urban transitions. We present four transformation modalities that reconsider people-place, people-nature, and people-institutional relations pertinent to environmental justice and use case examples to demonstrate their relevance to NBS planning. We conclude by offering two overarching principles for urban policy, planning, and governance for fostering just transitions through NBS. First, NBS planning needs to pur\- posively activate structural and emotional transformations through experimentation to enhance procedural justice. Second, NBS co-design and implementation should consider the dynamic interplay between recognition and distribution justice to engage multiple senses of place.},

In this paper we define a general approach to measuring spatial segregation among multiple population groups. This general approach allows researchers to specify any theoretically based definition of spatial proximity desired in computing segregation measures. Based on this general approach, we develop a general spatial exposure/isolation index ({\~P}*), and a set of general multigroup spatial evenness/clustering indices: a spatial information theory index ({\~H}), a spatial relative diversity index ({\~R}), and a spatial dissimilarity index ({\~D}). We review these and previously proposed spatial segregation indices against a set of eight desirable properties of spatial segregation indices. We conclude that the spatial exposure I isolation index {\~P}* - which can be interpreted as a measure of the average composition of individuals' local spatial environments - and the spatial information theory index {\~H} - which can be interpreted as a measure of the variation in the diversity of the local spatial environments of each individual - are the most conceptually and mathematically satisfactory of the proposed spatial indices.},

These models are rich enough to speak to first-order features of the data, such as many heterogeneous locations and gravity equation relationships for trade and commuting.

When levels of armed violence in urban areas are sufficient to trigger international humanitarian law, organizations such as the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) may argue that they have an important contribution to make by offering a set of skills and experience gleaned in conflict and non-governed settings. This paper reflects on this humanitarian turn to the city and uses it to problematize certain assumptions within the existing understanding of ``urban violence'' and the nature of humanitarianism itself. What does it mean to ``humanitarianize'' urban violence? What is the value-added that humanitarians might bring? And in what ways might such engagements be changing the nature of the problem itself? Drawing upon a wide range of literature that sets the local structures of violence in light of wider national and international processes, we analyze the ``humanitarianization'' of urban violence as a cross-scalar governmental assemblage that is likely to play an increasingly important role in cities in the global South in the future.},

  abstract = {A shift towards a more Circular Economy is crucial to achieve a more sustainable and inclusive built environment that meets future demands. Circular Economy is a promising concept for industry and society. If implemented well, Circular Economy can deliver environmental benefits and economic advantages for which innovation is essential. To achieve a resource-efficient built environment the Circular Economy should be developed and implemented systemically and on a large scale, going beyond cities. To realise this, local authorities, citizens, and other stakeholders need a collaborative and science-informed decision environment that allows for developing different waste and resource management options, and assessing their impacts on the environment, resilience, spatial quality and quality of life. The articles in this special issue all discuss different aspects of research to deliver solutions and strategies for a circular economy in urban planning throughout Europe, focusing on peri-urban locations. The first article introduces Living Labs as a methodology to co-create circular solutions and strategies with local stakeholders. The second article focuses on governance for the shift towards a Circular Economy, unravelling hindrances and revealing objectives, whereas the third article develops a means to transfer circular strategies and solutions from one location to another. The fourth article presents an open-source tool based on the geodesign approach which links the co-creation of design proposals to impact simulations informed by geographic contexts, systems thinking, and digital technology{\textemdash}the Geodesign Decision Support Environment. Finally, the fifth article presents the first results of incorporating the concept of Circular Economy in an integrative manner in urban design and planning courses.},

National governments displayed exceptional solidarity at the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Summit, when they adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Furthermore, the global discussion around the New Urban Agenda (NUA) of Habitat III has made it moderately clear that most of the other SDGs cannot be achieved without sustainable urbanisation, and vice versa. As the operational implications of the political commitment made by governments slowly sink in, the article offers a set of reflections on the role of cities in the implementation of the SDGs, NUA and the Paris climate accord. Moreover, it underlines the need for a comprehensive, multidimensional framework to facilitate the implementation of sustainable urbanisation in light of a new global urban agenda.},

  abstract = {Two years ago at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit, all 193 member countries of the UN unanimously agreed, at the highest political level, on the importance of sustainable urbanisation as one of the keystones of the 2030 Sustainable Development agenda (United Nations, 2015). Even the UN system, which is better known for its glacial pace of change, is starting to shift from a fragmented twentieth-century orientation to an integrated, multi-level and multi-stakeholder, contemporary response to the global processes of urbanisation. Sustainable urbanisation and addressing the local-to-global urban agenda are increasingly being seen as necessary conditions to enable the successful implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and to ensure that `no person' and `no place is left behind'. This goes beyond a narrow focus on `urban' SDG 11, `sustainable cities and communities', which emphasises housing, planning and mobility; embracing the delivery of most other SDGs such as ending poverty, reducing inequality, providing basic universal services of education, health, energy and water; and protecting the local and global environment (Revi, 2016). As we enter the first (urban) era of the Anthropocene, the UN may be well placed to play a pivotal role in using sustainable urbanisation to enhance peace, security and sustainable developmental opportunities for all citizens of its member countries and their sub-national governments. Marking a significant departure from the past is the emergent role of local authorities, which have often been marginal to these processes despite usually being responsible for day-to-day service delivery and development implementation. A step forward in this journey is the recently concluded UN Secretary General's High-Level Panel (HLP) report on the New Urban Agenda (NUA) (UN-Habitat, 2016) that was adopted by the Habitat III conference in Quito in October 2016 (UN, 2017a). It provides the UN with a low-risk test case for institutional reform, beginning with one of its weakest, most marginal and least credible institutions: UN-Habitat (UN-H).},

The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle system, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

  abstract = {Socio-economic related properties of a city grow faster than a linear relationship with the population, in a log{\textendash}log plot, the so-called superlinear scaling. Conversely, the larger a city, the more efficient it is in the use of its infrastructure, leading to a sublinear scaling on these variables. In this work, we addressed a simple explanation for those scaling laws in cities based on the interaction range between the citizens and on the fractal properties of the cities. To this purpose, we introduced a measure of social potential which captured the influence of social interaction on the economic performance and the benefits of amenities in the case of infrastructure offered by the city. We assumed that the population density depends on the fractal dimension and on the distance-dependent interactions between individuals. The model suggests that when the city interacts as a whole, and not just as a set of isolated parts, there is improvement of the socio-economic indicators. Moreover, the bigger the interaction range between citizens and amenities, the bigger the improvement of the socio-economic indicators and the lower the infrastructure costs of the city. We addressed how public policies could take advantage of these properties to improve cities development, minimizing negative effects. Furthermore, the model predicts that the sum of the scaling exponents of social-economic and infrastructure variables are 2, as observed in the literature. Simulations with an agent-based model are confronted with the theoretical approach and they are compatible with the empirical evidences.},

  abstract = {Opportunities for innovation in urban expansion research abound given the emergence of longitudinal and spatially explicit data. Scholars now use a broad array of data when analyzing expansion, yet the conceptual approach remains limited. Toward this end, this work extends conceptualization of expansion beyond the relatively simple economic approach that emphasizes population growth and income. Instead, insights from social{\textendash}ecological theory{\textemdash}focusing on the heterogeneous, nonlinear, and hierarchical nature of cities{\textemdash}provide a pathway for specifying urban expansion gradients. The paper demonstrates how a spatial gradient model that considers urban, periphery, and exurban subregions complexifies the urban regional phenomenon, yielding crucial insights into the processes that drive expansion. Exploratory quantitative analysis of the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) provides a prototype implementation, testing the utility of the gradientbased approach for all urban regions in the contiguous United States. Modeling covers both the full study period, 2001{\textendash}16, and as separate 2001{\textendash}11 and 2011{\textendash}16 panels, assessing how relationships change over time. Results show that social{\textendash}demographics, land use and transportation, regional economics, and physical drivers exhibit diverse impacts across the expansion gradient and over time. This work concludes with a call for scholars to deepen the approach presented here before conducting predictive or confirmatory modeling.},

  abstract = {Cities exist in a world of cities and thus routinely invite a comparative gesture in urban theorizing. However, for some decades urban studies have analytically divided the world of cities into, for example, wealthier and poorer, capitalist and socialist, or into different regional groupings of cities, with subsequently very little comparative research across these divides. Interest in drawing comparisons among different cities has escalated in an era of 'globalization', as economic and social activities as well as governance structures link cities together through spatially extensive flows of various kinds and intense networks of communication. Nonetheless, scholars of urban studies have been relatively reluctant to pursue the potential for international comparative research that stands at the heart of the field. Where an interest in globalization has drawn authors to explicit exercises in comparison, both the methodological resources and the prevalent intellectual and theoretical landscape have tended to limit and even undermine these initiatives. This article seeks, first, to understand why it is that in an intrinsically comparative field with an urgent contemporary need for thinking across different urban experiences, there has been relatively little comparative research, especially comparisons that stretch across the global North-South divide, or across contexts of wealthier and poorer cities. Secondly, through a review of existing strategies for comparing cities, the article considers the potential for comparative methodologies to overcome their limitations to meet growing demands for international and properly post-colonial urban studies. Finally, it proposes a new phase of comparative urban research that is experimental, but with theoretically rigorous foundations. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author.

Using the example of city-wide strategic policymaking in Johannesburg, this essay argues for an enrichment of our vocabularies for appreciating how wider circuits of urban policy shape localized policy outcomes. Rather than tracing policies until they arrive somewhere, a more nuanced spatiality of policy mobility emerges when considering how policies are 'arrived at'. Thus policy influences can, for example, be ephemeral and recursive, international but already present in localities, have many simultaneous origins, and be folded into a relatively amorphous but specific policy blend. Drawing on John Allen's account of topological space, the essay indicates how both a more subtle spatiality and a more open politics of policy formation would emerge from turning the analysis of policy mobilities on its head in this way.},

The challenge is to develop methods and theoretical practices which allow conceptual innovation to emerge from any urban situation or urbanization process, sustaining wider conversations while insisting that concepts are open to revision. This maps well on to the core methodological problematic of comparison. Mindful of the strong limits to comparison presented by conventional quasi-scientific methods, this paper sets out the basis for a reformatted comparative method. A new grounding for comparison is proposed, specific to the field of the urban, and a new typology of tactics for undertaking urban comparative research is suggested. The paper weaves together classic approaches and more recent innovations in comparison from within urban studies with a wider philosophical analysis of the issues at stake in reframing the architecture of comparison. The paper stands as an invitation to practise global urban studies differently {\textendash} comparatively {\textendash} but also to practise comparison differently, in a way that opens urban studies to a more global repertoire of potential insights. The paper develops this invitation and methodological quest through Marxist political-economy; through actually-existing vernacular comparative practices of urban studies; and through insights gleaned from Gilles Deleuze's philosophical project. The last section of the paper explains how this new vocabulary of comparative method can be put to work through a review of some recent experiments in the field of global urban studies.},

  abstract = {There has been growing interest in the expansion of global investment in urban areas, and the financialisation of urban development, both of which bring new business logics into the production of the built environment and shape urban outcomes. At the same time, mega urban projects have continued and spread as a significant format of urban expansion and renewal, often strongly linked to transnational investors and developers. Nonetheless, the distinctive regulatory and political contexts within which transnational actors must bring such projects to fruition matter greatly to outcomes, with territorialised governance arrangements both shaping and being shaped by transnational dynamics. However, there has been little systematic comparative consideration of these diverse regulatory contexts in their own right, rather than as contributors to wider circulating processes such as neoliberalisation. As a result, the implications of different regulatory regimes for urban outcomes have not been effectively assessed. In this paper we therefore broaden the discussion from globalised processes of ``financialisation'' to consider three large-scale urban development projects from the perspective of their distinctive ``business models'', including their place in achieving wider strategic objectives at national and metropolitan scales, their agile and often bespoke institutional configurations, and their different forms of financing, taxation and land value capture. Our cases are Lingang, Shanghai (one of nine planned satellite cities), the Corridors of Freedom project in Johannesburg (a linear transport oriented development seeking to integrate the racially divided city), and Old Oak and Park Royal in north-west London (under a mayoral development corporation, associated with significant new metropolitan and national transport investments). We observe that the business models adopted, notably in relation to financial calculations and income streams associated with the developments, are a result of strongly path dependent formats of governance and income generation in each case. However we want to move beyond seeing these as residual, as contingent and contextual to wider accounts of urban development focussed on globalised financial flows and calculations. Using a comparative approach we initiate a systematic analytical conversation about the implications of different business models for the form and socio-economic potential of mega-urban development projects.},

Together with the previous conditions, it is suggested that it is necessary to include another which represents a structural element of an urban sub-system within the metropolitan configuration-that is, a place with intense spatial interaction with its hinterland. Therefore, a metropolitan area can be seen as one comprising urban sub-systems characterised by greater or lesser polycentrism. In this paper, a 'bottom-up' methodology based on commuter flows is proposed in order to detect metropolitan sub-centres. Using empirical data from the Metropolitan Region of Barcelona, the proposed methodology is tested, comparing its results with those of other commonly used methodologies (cut-offs, parametric and non-parametric models). The results suggest that the proposed methodology permits optimising the sub-centre delimitation process. {\textcopyright} 2009 Urban Studies Journal Limited.},

In this respect our findings, based on in-depth interviews with Israeli planners, suggest that the case of Jerusalem represents a particularly dramatic illustration of the fact that the function of planning expertise can only be understood in relation to the surrounding socio-political environment. Furthermore, contrary to conventional wisdom, planners in Jerusalem are not destined to either complicity or irrelevance in the face of political imperatives; planners' agency, however, does not simply reflect their mastery of specific professional knowledge and tools, but also their ability to act strategically in relation to the context in which they operate.},

Results indicate that proxies for labor market pooling have the most robust effect, positively influencing agglomeration at all levels of geography. Proxies for knowledge spillovers, in contrast, positively affect agglomeration only at the zipcode level. Reliance on manufactured inputs or natural resources positively affects agglomeration at the state level but has little effect on agglomeration at lower levels of geography.

Recently, the literature has also begun to provide evidence on the microfoundations of external economies of scale. The best known of these sources are those attributed to Marshall (1920): labor market pooling, input sharing, and knowledge spillovers. Evidence to date supports the presence of all three of these forces. In addition, there is also evidence that natural advantage, home market effects, consumption opportunities, and rent-seeking all contribute to agglomeration. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A central message is that although many locations exhibit extreme persistence in economic status, change in economic status as measured by various indicators of per capita income is common.

This is mirrored at the metropolitan level. Durable but slowly decaying housing, transportation infrastructure, and self-reinforcing spillovers all influence local income dynamics, as do enduring natural advantages, amenities, and government policy. Three recurring themes run throughout the paper: (i) Long sweeps of time are typically necessary to appreciate that change in economic status is common, (ii) history matters, and (iii) a combination of static and dynamic forces ensures that income dynamics can and do differ dramatically across locations but in ways that can be understood.},

We show that patterns of intraurban movement are strongly heterogeneous in terms of volume, but not in terms of distance travelled, and that there is a polycentric structure composed of large flows organized around a limited number of activity centers. For smaller flows, the pattern of connections becomes richer and more complex and is not strictly hierarchical since it mixes different levels consisting of different orders of magnitude. This new understanding can shed light on the impact of new urban projects on the evolution of the polycentric configuration of a city and the dense structure of its centers and it provides an initial approach to modeling flows in an urban system. {\textcopyright} 2011 Roth et al.},

The hierarchy referred to variously as the 'Knowledge Hierarchy', the 'Information Hierarchy' and the 'Knowledge Pyramid' is one of the fundamental, widely recognized and 'taken-for-granted' models in the information and knowledge literatures. It is often quoted, or used implicitly, in definitions of data, information and knowledge in the information management, information systems and knowledge management literatures, but there has been limited direct discussion of the hierarchy. After revisiting Ackoff's original articulation of the hierarchy, definitions of data, information, knowledge and wisdom as articulated in recent textbooks in information systems and knowledge management are reviewed and assessed, in pursuit of a consensus on definitions and transformation processes. This process brings to the surface the extent of agreement and dissent in relation to these definitions, and provides a basis for a discussion as to whether these articulations present an adequate distinction between data, information, and knowledge. Typically information is defined in terms of data, knowledge in terms of information, and wisdom in terms of knowledge, but there is less consensus in the description of the processes that transform elements lower in the hierarchy into those above them, leading to a lack of definitional clarity. In addition, there is limited reference to wisdom in these texts. {\textcopyright} CILIP.},

  abstract = {T he study of cities is today marked by a paradox: much of the urban growth of the st century is taking place in the developing world, but many of the theories of how cities function remain rooted in the developed world. There is much discussion in academic circles about whether the time has come to move from the Chicago school of urban sociology to the Los Angeles school of postmodern geography (Dear, ), and yet, as urban sociologist Douglas Massey () recently commented, the urban future lies neither in Chicago nor Los Angeles; it instead lies in " Third World " cities like Rio de Janeiro, Mumbai, Hong Kong. Beyond this mundane fact of urban growth is also the pressing issue of what might be learned by paying attention to the urban transformations of the developing world. This is not simply an issue of the inappropriateness of Euro-American ideas for Third World cities. Planning practices are constantly borrowed and replicated across borders. To attempt to stem this tide is rather useless and indeed under some circumstances can mark a turn to isolationism. Instead, I am interested in what it means to locate the production of theory and policy in the cities of the developing world. In an important article, Jennifer Robinson () shows how the field of urban studies is constituted through a duality: global cities versus megacities. Global cities are conceptualized as First World command nodes of a global system of informational capitalism, " models " for the rest of the world (Robinson, , pp. {\textendash}). In contrast, megacities, located primarily in the Third World, are conceptualized in terms of crisis{\textemdash} " big but not powerful " (Robinson, , p. ). There is an urgency for urban studies and planning to move beyond the dichotomy of First World " models " and Third World " problems. " One possible route is through policy approaches that seek to learn from Third World cities (Roy, b; Sanyal, ). In this article, I trace such a route by discussing one key theme of Third World research: urban informality and policy responses to informality, such as slum upgrading and land titling.  My goal is not so much to evaluate these policies as it is to highlight some of the distinctive challenges and paradoxes that they present for planners. Three are of particular importance: how planning modalities can produce the " unplannable " {\textemdash}informality as a state of exception from the formal order of urbanization; how this state of exception can in turn be strategically used by planners to mitigate some of the vulnerabilities of the urban  Many of the significant urban transfor-mations of the new century are taking place in the developing world. In par-ticular, informality, once associated with poor squatter settlements, is now seen as a generalized mode of metropolitan urbanization. This article focuses on urban informality to highlight the chal-lenges of dealing with the " unplannable " {\textemdash}exceptions to the order of formal ur-banization. It argues that planners must learn to work with this state of exception. Such policy epistemologies are useful not only for " Third World " cities but also more generally for urban planning concerned with distributive justice.},

The articles thus draw attention to the multiplicity of urbanisms that constitute the contemporary world system, thereby disrupting the rather restricted analytics of global cities and world cities. Secondly, the articles pay careful attention to the forms of worlding at work in such urbanisms, demonstrating how the production of the urban takes place in the crucible of modernizing projects of development, regimes of immigration and governance and experiments with neoliberalism and market rule.Thirdly, this special issue seeks to explore the implications of such research and analysis for the field of ideas currently constituted as planning theory. How does the study of urbanisms allow a rigorous understanding of planning as the organization and transformation of space? How can planning theory make sense of seemingly unplanned spaces that lie outside the grid of visible order? In what ways is planning itself a worlding practice, such that models, best practices, expertise and capital circulate in transnational fashion, creating new worlds of planning common sense?. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {The urban sprawl phenomenon has attracted the attention of social researchers since the mid-20th century. It seemed that all relevant aspects had been extensively studied and that it would be difficult to produce new studies with significant contributions. However, in the last decade, we have witnessed a revival of the literature on urban sprawl for three main reasons: (i) the existence of new methodologies to measure the phenomenon based on digital cartography and geo-referenced information, (ii) new hypotheses about the relevance of the formation of metropolitan areas not institutionally integrated into urban sprawl in many places and, mainly, (iii) the role of urban density in the environmental sustainability of cities. The recent literature on this third aspect has grown the most and around which it seems that new and interesting lines of future research will develop. The objective of this work is to present a synthetic review of the most recent literature on urban sprawl as of the end of the second decade of the XXI century. This review can serve to recapitulate the growing consensus that is being formed on the lower environmental sustainability of low-density cities and diffuse limits.},

Du Bois' attempts to gain acceptance from the American Economic Association failed. Following this, there was a long period during which economic issues relating to the Black population were rarely considered at all by White economists. This despite the Great Migration of Blacks to Northern cities. These issues were dealt with by Black scholars working within Black organizations and colleges and mostly in sociology or history rather than economics. They created what has become known as Black labour studies, but the work they produced was ignored by the established economics profession. It is only after World War II that work dealing with Black issues became acceptable enough to appear in leading economics journals.},

In the AHP, a decision hierarchy is constructed with a goal, criteria and alternatives. The criteria are pairwise compared for their importance with respect to the goal to derive a scale of relative importance and the alternatives are pairwise compared with respect to each criterion to derive relative scales. The relative scales are synthesized using a weighting and adding process to show which is the best alternative. Judgment is used to make the pairwise comparisons. Data can also be used directly in the pairwise comparisons if there is no need to assess or interpret the value represented by the numbers. This process works well for intangibles with no existing scales of measurement. Even when measurement scales and data using these scales exist, it is often advantageous to use judgment to interpret it. Two concepts integral to the AHP, measurement and consistency, are explained. Finally, the ideas and the method are illustrated through an example.},

We use data at the level of Urban Agglomerations in India from the Census 2011 and from a few other sources to characterize patterns of urban population density, infrastructure, urban services, economic performance, crime and innovation. Many of the results are in line with expectations from urban theory and with the behaviour of analogous quantities in other urban systems in both high and middle-income nations. India is a continental scale, fast developing urban system, and consequently there are also a number of interesting exceptions and surprises related to both specific quantities and strong regional patterns of variation. We characterize these patterns in detail for crime and innovation and connect them to the existing literature on their determinants in a specifically Indian context. The paucity of data at the urban level and the absence of official definitions for functional cities in India create a number of limitations and caveats to any present analysis. We discuss these shortcomings and spell out the challenge for a systematic statistical data collection relevant to cities and urban development in India.},

Yet, social theory, largely developed and tested in the Global North, is often inadequate in tackling the realities of life in the dangerous parts of cities in the Global South. Drawing on the findings of an ambitious five-year, 15-project research programme, Social Theories of Urban Violence in the Global South offers a uniquely Southern perspective on the violence-poverty-inequalities dynamics in cities of the Global South. Through their research, urban violence experts based in low-and middle-income countries demonstrate how ``urban violence'' means different things to different people in different places. While some researchers adopt or adapt existing theoretical and conceptual frameworks, others develop and test new theories, each interpreting and operationalizing the concept of urban violence in the particular context in which they work. In particular, the book highlights the links between urban violence, poverty, and inequalities based on income, class, gender, and other social cleavages. Providing important new perspectives from the Global South, this book will be of interest to policymakers, academics, and students with an interest in violence and exclusion in the cities of developing countries.},

Adaptive complex cities operate as systems and they obey certain universal laws: the distribution of elements reflects organic growth processes, such as the ones described by allometric growth and inverse power laws in biology. Their elements and connections organization does not obey Gaussian laws (concentration around averages). They are not aggregates of inert elements but integrated highly differentiated self-organized wholes. They exhibit a hierarchical configurational order characteristic of complex adaptive systems, with nested subsystems ordered in a hierarchy of scales united by mathematical regularities. Planners need to be aware of these laws of adaptive complexity and plan with rather than counter to these emergent properties in order to enhance resilience. Understanding the universality of complex systems order, which characterizes living systems, and which modernist city planning has violated, would allow planning more resilient cities.},

This research identifies urban expansion patterns in five of the largest urban agglomerations in Colombia. Urban growth is analysed using satellite images (Landsat 5) and census data to assess spatiotemporal land-use changes over a 30-year period (1990{\textendash}2020). The actual urban extents are compared with each city's land-use predictions, instruments, and regulations to ascertain whether local authorities have the capabilities to predict land demand and to guide development processes at the municipal level. The predictions made by local authorities are inaccurate and often underestimate the rates of population growth and land requirements. The findings reveal that local authorities lack the capabilities to manage urban growth and deliver sustainable urban development. This is leading to poor outcomes: low planning standards, urban informality and inefficient land use.},

Its examination in the context of urban-based non-state armed groups contributes to our understanding of the local pol- itics of armed conflict. Local power, defined as the ability of an armed actor to coerce or co-opt people to abide by a set of rules in a specific urban area, is a relational concept profoundly influ- enced by the urban space. The main specificity of urban-based power is the propensity of cities, as hubs for different forms of contestation, to concentrate resources and illicit economies favouring non-state armed activity. This concentration, or power density, plays an important role in transitions from armed conflict to peace: the main argument here is that power density facilitates the transition of armed conflict into other, mainly criminal, forms of organised violence while retaining their spatial concentration in marginalised areas (peripheries, slums). The article discusses the conceptual aspects of local power and proceeds to an empirical case study focused on the Colombian city of Medell{\'i}n, affected by a variety of non-state armed actors and a transition from ideolo- gically-driven to criminal armed groups during the 2000s.},

  abstract = {The larger visual identity of a city is often a blend of smaller and distinct visual character zones. Despite the recent popularity of street-view imagery for visual analytics, its role in uncovering such urban visual clusters has been fairly limited. Taking Mumbai as a demonstrative case, we present what is arguably the first city-wide visual cluster analysis of an Indian metropolis. We use a Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) for semantic segmentation of over 28000 Google Street View (GSV) images collected from over 7000 locations across the city. Unsupervised k-means clustering is carried out on the extracted semantic features (such as greenery, skyview, built-density etc.) for the identification of distinct urban visual typologies. Through iterative analysis, 7 key visual clusters are identified, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to visualize the variance across them. The feature distributions of each cluster are then qualitatively and quantitatively analysed in order to examine their unique visual configurations. Spatial distributions of the clusters are visualized as well, thus mapping out the different `faces' of the city. It is hoped that the methodology outlined in this work serves as a base for similar cluster-based inquiries into the visual dimension of other cities across the globe.},

  abstract = {Recent tragedies such as Hurricane Katrina, 9/11, and the 2008 Sichuan Earthquake have revealed a need for methods to evaluate and plan for the impact of extreme events on critical infrastructure. In particular, awareness has been raised of the threat that a major disruption will lead to cascading failures that cross boundaries between interdependent infrastructure sectors, greatly magnifying human and economic impacts. To assist in planning for such extreme events, researchers are developing modeling tools to aid in making decisions about how best to protect critical infrastructures. We present some of the capabilities of this modeling approach as well as some of the challenges faced in developing such applications based on our experience with the Critical Infrastructure Protection Decision Support System (CIPDSS) model, developed for use by the Department of Homeland Security. A set of disruptions to road and telecommunication infrastructures is implemented in CIPDSS and the modeled disruptions to the original infrastructure as well as cascading effects on other infrastructure sectors are discussed. These simulations provide insights into the potential of this approach. {\textcopyright} 2009 Policy Studies Organization.},

  abstract = {Urban scaling laws summarise how socio-economic behaviours of urban systems may be predicted from city size. While most scaling analysis rests on using aggregate quantities (total incomes, GDP, etc.), examining distributions of these aggregate quantities (e.g. income distributions) could shed light on how socio-economic inequalities may correlate or be causally linked to city size. In this direction, this paper examines how geographic distributions and spatial inequalities of income and housing costs vary by city size. The paper presents three principal results. First, it brings out qualitative implications of quantitative scaling by relating scaling of the distributions of income and housing costs to their specific geographic concentrations. Second, it shows that some small and medium sized cities are clear outliers, showing behaviour similar to the largest cities and starkly different from the behaviours of the bulk of small and medium sized cities. Third, this above observation explains why heteroscedasticity, or large and heterogeneous fluctuations, are frequently observed in urban indicator data when plotted as a function of city size. Putting together these three results, overall, it is shown that income distributions and housing costs scale and concentrate in cities by size in a predictable way, where the largest cities superlinearly/disproportionately agglomerate the highest income earners and the highest housing costs, and show relatively lower concentrations of low-middle income earners and low-medium housing costs. In contrast, most of the smaller and medium sized cities show a `flipped' opposite trend. A few small and medium sized cities are outliers: they show trends that match those of the largest cities, due to specialisations of economic functions or concentrations of high-paying occupations in these cities. The empirical findings lead to a discussion on the objective and normative relationships between city size and urban inequalities. It is suggested that due to the concentrations of high income and high housing costs, largest cities may have a resulting housing market structure that will push out lower and medium income earners, thereby making affordability, diversity, and socio-spatial justice emerge as important urban policy issues.},

Additionally, there is a need to represent the uncertainty in the predictions of tsunami characteristics corresponding to the uncertain trigger features (e.g. either position, shape and speed of a landslide, or sea floor deformation associated with an earthquake). Unfortunately, computer models are expensive to run. This leads to significant delays in predictions and makes the uncertainty quantification impractical. Statistical emulators run almost instantaneously and may represent well the outputs of the computer model. In this paper, we use the outer product emulator to build a fast statistical surrogate of a landslide-generated tsunami computer model. This Bayesian framework enables us to build the emulator by combining prior knowledge of the computer model properties with a few carefully chosen model evaluations. The good performance of the emulator is validated using the leave-one-out method. {\textcopyright} 2012 Author(s).},

  abstract = {As researchers have continued to expand the bounds of green gentrification scholarship, understanding of what green gentrification is and how to identify the phenomenon on the ground has grown obscured. In an attempt to bring clarity to this conversation, our research presents an urban green gentrification framework, based on findings from a scoping review and dimensional analysis conducted across green gentrification, urban greening, and related literatures. Our study is guided by two primary objectives: (1) identify the key dimensions of green gentrification as it pertains to urban greening; and (2) explore the relationships and intersections between di\- mensions in terms of their implications for the social impacts and outcomes of urban greening initiatives. We identify three principle dimensions of green gentrification as it relates to urban greening {\textemdash} conceptual founda\- tions; design and intent; and socio-spatial change {\textemdash} as well as six related sub-dimensions. Considered in tandem, these dimensions present green gentrification as a dynamic process bound within a history of exploitative, neoliberal social and economic processes, operating beyond the scope of any single urban greening initiative. Responding to green gentrification, therefore, requires trans-dimensional strategies that consider these structural influences guiding patterns of urban greening investment and development. Our results also show that green gentrification is not a sufficient explanation for the complexities of urban development and change, and greening should be considered alongside other drivers of gentrification more broadly.},

  abstract = {In 2013 the Cape Town municipality initiated planning for the second phase of its MyCiTi bus system. The first phase, on which preparations commenced in 2007, relied on incorporating existing road-based operators in a bus rapid transit (BRT) system. The municipality underestimated the cost and level of effort involved in the wholesale corporatisation of paratransit operators while concurrently equipping them to become BRT operators. Learning from this experience, it developed a more incremental transition approach in the second phase, the first fruit of which was a pilot express bus service launched in mid-2014. The pilot service contract also provided for a training programme for paratransit operators in the affected parts of the city to build their managerial and technical capacity. It was envisaged that programme participants would ultimately manage and run the long-term operating companies and contracts that would be established by the end of the three-year interim period. This article provides a critical review of the programme's context, content and participant experiences after the conclusion of its first year. In broad terms the programme has made a positive contribution to paratransit participants' understanding of the shortcomings of their current operations and why reform might be necessary, but much still remains to be done to enable them to fill their envisaged roles in future public transport operations. In view of growing interest in BRT installation in Sub-Saharan Africa lessons from Cape Town's reform process offer both cautionary evidence and a potential mechanism for drawing existing operators in as partners in reform.},

One model is a simulation in which individual members of two recognizable groups distribute themselves in neighborhoods defined by reference to their own locations. A second model is analytic and deals with compartmented space. A final section applies the analytics to `neighborhood tipping.' The systemic effects are found to be overwhelming: there is no simple correspondence of individual incentive to collective results. Exaggerated separation and patterning result from the dynamics of movement. Inferences about individual motives can usually not be drawn from aggregate patterns. Some unexpected phenomena, like density and vacancy, are generated. A general theory of `tipping' begins to emerge. {\textcopyright} 1971, Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

I begin by critiquing Brenner and Schmid's concept of planetary urbanization which erases difference among cities and locates the essence of urbanity in the global North. I echo their criticism of postcolonial urbanism, however, which has struggled to articulate precisely how Southern cities differ from their Northern counterparts. I then propose three tendencies that, when taken together, serve as the basis of an emergent paradigm of Southern urbanism. First, I assert that cities in the South tend to exhibit a persistent disconnect between capital and labor. Second, I demonstrate that their metabolic configurations are discontinuous, dynamic and contested. Finally, I argue that political economy is not the overriding context within which urban processes unfold, but rather it is always already co-constituted with the materiality of Southern cities. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list of characteristics exhibited uniformly by all cities in the global South. Instead, I hope that it serves as a starting point for city-centric scholarship that can account for very real differences between/among cities without constructing cities in the South as pathological and in need of development interventions.},

The results of a literature review and a matching exercise to determine the relationship between CE practices and SDG targets show that CE practices, potentially, can contribute directly to achieving a significant number of SDG targets. The strongest relationships exist between CE practices and the targets of SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). The paper also explores synergies that can be created through CE practices among several of the SDG targets. Furthermore, it identifies several potential trade-offs between targets for decent work, safe working environments, human health and current CE practices relating to recycling of municipal waste, e-waste and wastewater, and provides suggestions how these can be overcome. The paper concludes that CE practices can be applied as a ``toolbox'' and specific implementation approaches for achieving a sizeable number of SDG targets. Further empirical research is necessary to determine which specific types of partnerships and means of implementation are required to apply CE practices in the SDG context.},

One major challenge in humanitarian mine action (HMA) is finding new and integrated approaches to land release, which remains a slow and costly process. The use of geographic information systems (GIS) in HMA can improve the land release process by efficient mapping and prioritizing of landmine risk areas. This study explores the usage of aspatial and spatial regression techniques to construct a predictive geo-statistical model for landmine risk mapping in a small 160 km2 municipality in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and a large 4500 km2 region in Colombia. The first application of logistic geographically weighted regression to landmine risk mapping is presented. The results show that in the BiH study area, the effect of local parameters that influence the distribution of landmine risk varies significantly across the study area. Conversely, in the Colombia case study the effect of explanatory variables remains more homogeneous over the study area. We produced two landmine risk maps for each study area, based on aspatial and spatial regression models. Risk maps are classified into five classes, i.e. very low, low, medium, high, and very high risk. The landmine risk maps created through the usage of these innovative methodologies improve the assessment of risk and prioritization of the land release process in mine-contaminated areas, compared to existing approaches.},

The importance of cities of 1 to 5 million inhabitants is poverty reducing. We conclude that developing countries with a large share of the population living in very big cities could reduce poverty by deconcentrating their urbanization toward cities of between 1 and 5 million inhabitants.},

However, despite projections that world urban populations will increase to nearly 5 billion by 2030, little is known about future locations, magnitudes, and rates of urban expansion. Here we develop spatially explicit probabilistic forecasts of global urban land-cover change and explore the direct impacts on biodiversity hotspots and tropical carbon biomass. If current trends in population density continue and all areas with high probabilities of urban expansion undergo change, then by 2030, urban land cover will increase by 1.2 million km 2, nearly tripling the global urban land area circa 2000. This increase would result in considerable loss of habitats in key biodiversity hotspots, with the highest rates of forecasted urban growth to take place in regions that were relatively undisturbed by urban development in 2000: the Eastern Afromontane, the Guinean Forests of West Africa, and the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka hotspots. Within the pan-tropics, loss in vegetation biomass from areas with high probability of urban expansion is estimated to be 1.38 PgC (0.05 PgC yr-1), equal to {$\sim$}5\% of emissions from tropical deforestation and land-use change. Although urbanization is often considered a local issue, the aggregate global impacts of projected urban expansion will require significant policy changes to affect future growth trajectories to minimize global biodiversity and vegetation carbon losses.},

They became adept at combining drawings, diagrams, and charts to map information and make visual arguments for urban transformation. These techniques were tools of cultural critique and anticipation that shaped American understandings and expectations of cities. This essay surveys the imagery of urban planning as a prompt to historians to pay close attention to the visual culture of urban planning.},

  abstract = {Central areas enjoy greater efficiency in the production of goods and services than do outlying areas. Because of the inherent advantages of central areas over outlying areas, disparities among regions do not vanish over time. On the contrary, centripetal forces increase inequalities across space. The phenomena of increased globalization, trade liberalization and treaties among countries not only enable the flow of labour, products (export) and foreign direct investment but also help reduce spatial inequality between countries. These phenomena also induce greater spatial economic concentration within a country. Thus, although disparities among countries decrease, a widening gap is observed between regions within countries and within large urban areas. In the empirical part, we analyse the general patterns of spatial inequality found among 55 localities in Israel with population size over 20,000. Looking at the spatial inequality relationship, both within and between cities in Israel, we show how all economic indicators measured, including inequality, decrease with distance from the core. Localities in the periphery that experience greater equality also experience lower average income, lower education, less self-employment and more unemployment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

In this study, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is combined with a Geographical Information System (GIS) for flood risk analysis and evaluation in the town of Enrile, a flood-prone area located in northern Philippines. Expert opinions, together with geographical, statistical and historical data, were collected and then processed through fuzzy membership. The AHP results showed the relative weights of three identified flood risk factors, and these results were validated to be consistent, using a standard consistency index. Using the Quantum GIS software, the factor weights from the AHP were incorporated to produce a map that is color-coded representing 5 levels of estimated flood risks. Using such a GIS weighted overlay analysis map as guide, local councils and other stakeholders can act to prepare for potential flooding when the rains come or, better yet, proactively promote appropriate land-use policy that will minimize threat to lives due to flooding. Index Terms{\textemdash}Analytic hierarchy process (AHP), decision support system, geographic information system (GIS), land-use policy.},

The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. By contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go by reinforcement learning from self-play. In this paper, we generalize this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve superhuman performance in many challenging games. Starting from random play and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero convincingly defeated a world champion program in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess), as well as Go.},

Both are defined as statistics to be calculated from sample data and not in terms of population constants. The index of diversity has so far been used chiefly with the logarithmic distribution. It cannot be used everywhere, as it does not always give values which are independent of sample size ; it cannot do so, for example, when applied to an infinite population of individuals classified into a finite number of groups. Williams3 has pointed out a relationship between the characteristic and the index of diversity when both are applied to a logarithmic distribution.

Part of the confusion arises because the dualistic approach of the hypothetico-deductive method conflicts with the inherent probabilism that underlies much of scientific methodology. I identify four weaknesses in the current approach to teaching students how researchers do science. First, most texts and many instructors tend to ignore the early, interesting, and often time-consuming stages of scientific methodology. Second, the hypothetico-deductive method uses counterintuitive logic to describe the relationship between hypotheses and predictions. Third, most null hypotheses are artificial constructs that tend to distance students from their initial biological questions. Finally, educators present an inconsistent message when they teach science as probabilistic and hypothesis testing as dualistic. I suggest a more holistic approach that identifies avoidable pitfalls and preserves the essential ingredients of the hypothetico-deductive method, while removing some of the arcane inaccuracies. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Biological Sciences.},

  abstract = {A substantial and diverse literature in economics traces its intellectual roots to Charles Tiebout's 1956 article, ``The Pure Theory of Local Expenditure.'' Its present recognition{\textemdash}frequently attributed to originating the idea of ``voting with your feet''{\textemdash}contrasts sharply with its obscurity during Tiebout's academic career, which was tragically cut short by his passing in 1968. Penned as a qualification to Paul Samuelson's ``pure theory,'' the article failed to influence the stabilization of postwar public good theory despite Tiebout's engagement with key figures in its construction. Moreover, his death preceded the application of its central mechanism to public, urban, and environmental topics via hedonic, sorting, and computational general equilibrium models. Viewed in this way, the history of Tiebout's article, and thereby the history of public economics, has remarkably little to do with Tiebout himself. In consequence, this article seeks to repersonalize and contextualize Tiebout's scientific work. Professionally, Tiebout 1956 reflected its author's lifelong interest in local economies and governance. The social and political context of urban sprawl and political fragmentation that accompanied the rapid growth of metropolitan areas, such as Chicago, Los Angeles, and Seattle, raised novel questions in local public finance for researchers before a knowledge community existed to credit their work. For Tiebout, it stimulated his collaboration with Vincent Ostrom and Robert Warren and later involvement in the interdisciplinary field of regional science.},

The main objective was to empirically determine an optimal radius size for measuring environmental attributes of the RN when using circular spatial buffers. HDRN maps from the Making Connections study were explored using minimum bounded circles (MBC). Baseline data on 4,742 community-dwelling adults showed that 30\% of people drew HDRN that included {$>$} 70\% of the MBC. We recommend 0.25 miles as an optimum radius size when attempting to measure aspects of the RN. Multivariate linear regressions indicated lower levels of circularity for females, non-Latino- others, for people living longer in their residential neighbourhood, and for large drawn polygons. In contrast, regression results indicated higher levels of circularity for non- Latino-blacks (compared to non-Latino-whites) and those with some college education (compared to those with a bachelors' degree and beyond). We conclude with advice on best practices for measuring environmental attributes of residential neighbourhoods when using circular spatial buffers.},

  abstract = {This paper synthesises the results of five IFPRI studies using household panel data from Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Mali, Mexico and Russia, which examine the extent to which households are able to insure their consumption from specific economic shocks and fluctuations in their real income. The extent of consumption insurance is defined by the degree to which the growth rate of household consumption covaries with the growth rate of household income. All the case studies show that food consumption is better insured than non-food consumption from idiosyncratic shocks. Adjustments in non-food consumption appear to act as a mechanism for partially insuring ex-post food consumption from the effects of income changes. Food consumption is also more likely to be covered by informal insurance arrangements at the community level than non-food consumption. Households use a portfolio of risk-coping strategies, but may not be equally able to use them. Poorer households may be less able to use mechanisms that rely on initial wealth as collateral. In this regard, public transfer programmes may have a more redistributive effect. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor \& Francis Group Ltd.},

Here, environmental problems like climate change and biodiversity loss have a higher impact than in other neighbourhoods. Applying Nature-based Solutions (NbS) may enhance the resilience of social housing neighbourhoods and as such make cities more just. In this article we explore to what extent NbS can be applied, given the physical, social and financial limitations that define Dutch social housing practice, and - by doing so {\textendash} what NbS can contribute to environmental justice. Based upon several Living Lab experiences and dialogues with numerous housing cor\- porations, ten NbS measures have been identified that likely will match with current practices in social housing. Implementing NbS contributes to all aspects of environmental justice, with distributional justice as the most straightforward one (more NbS means more environmental benefits). Procedural and recognitional justice were found to be of crucial importance to make greenspaces worthwhile for the residents. Our study draws attention to the fact that NbS knowledge is key but currently still insufficient, both within housing corporations as within the key partners (local authorities, landscaping firms). This means that there is a growing demand to increase NbS knowledge in the social housing sector. We finalize this article with recommendations on how to meet this demand.},

However, evidence is often scattered around different databases, web sites, and the gray literature and is often presented in inaccessible formats. Lack of overview of the evidence in a specific field can be a barrier to the use of existing research and prevent efficient use of limited resources for new research. Evidence \& Gap Maps (EGMs) aim to address these issues and complement existing synthesis and mapping approaches. EGMs are a new addition to the tools available to support evidence-informed policymaking. To provide an accessible resource for researchers, commissioners, and decision makers, EGMs provide thematic collections of evidence structured around a framework which schematically represents the types of interventions and outcomes of relevance to a particular sector. By mapping the existing evidence using this framework, EGMs provide a visual overview of what we know and do not know about the effects of different programs. They make existing evidence available, and by providing links to user-friendly summaries of relevant studies, EGMs can facilitate the use of existing evidence for decision making. They identify key ``gaps'' where little or no evidence from impact evaluations and systematic reviews is available and can be a valuable resource to inform a strategic approach to building the evidence base in a particular sector. The article will introduce readers to the concept and methods of EGMs and present a demonstration of the EGM tool using existing examples.},

The third generation requires the clear separation of context, narrative and content management and challenges the orthodoxy of scientific management. Complex adaptive systems theory is used to create a sense-making model that utilises self-organising capabilities of the informal communities and identifies a natural flow model of knowledge creation, disruption and utilisation. However, the argument from nature of many complexity thinkers is rejected given the human capability to create order and predictability through collective and individual acts of freewill.

With regard to research directed instead at estimating causal effects, we discuss three distinct weighting motives: (1) to achieve precise estimates by correcting for heteroskedasticity; (2) to achieve consistent estimates by correcting for endogenous sampling; and (3) to identify average partial effects in the presence of unmodeled heterogeneity of effects. In each case, we fi nd that the motive sometimes does not apply in situations where practitioners often assume it does.},

  abstract = {Most theoretical models of urban land use concentrate on residential density. Here we take up another important use of urban land, for roads, or, more generally, for transportation. We analyze, in the simplest possible setting, the optimal allocation of a given urban land area between the generation of traffic and the carrying of traffic. We show that, except in a limiting case, the proportion of land allocated to transportation is a decreasing, concave function of distance from the center of the city. We then analyze the competitive rent profile generated by any land-use pattern, on the assumptions that there are no congestion tolls for road use, and that commodities are sold at uniform delivered price with sellers absorbing transport cost. On these assumptions, we show that the market value of land may be a very poor guide to land-use decisions, and would lead to overallocation of land to transportation, especially near the center. Our model is one-dimensional because that is the best we can do now. We hope it will lead on to more realistic treatments of the problem.},

The method developed allows us to consider di{\textcurrency}erences in tech- nology across states and time, in addition to the usual identical technology assumption. Use of within-country data avoids many of the problems as- sociated with cross-country data that is usually used in such studies. In addition, the factor endowments approach is tested against several alter- native hypotheses on the determinants of the location of production. We {\ldots}nd that factor endowments and technology play important roles in ex- plaining the share of an industry. The factor endowments model is found to be superior to alternative explanations for share of industry, including economic development, government development expenditure, and mar- ket access. The liberalisation of the economy beginning in 1991 represents a clear structural break in the industrial sector.},

This emerging policy architecture places a range of municipal functions, infrastructures and services in the domain of the (private) township, paralleling processes of urban gating and enclave growth worldwide. This paper analyses the relevant policies and laws to examine the role of the state in facilitating the growth of such urban clubs in India and fostering privatised provision of public goods. With few evaluations of the scope and impacts of such urban development in India, the case of Jamshedpur, an early prototype of corporate urbanisation, highlights how such sites may encourage patterns of unplanned and under-provisioned growth around the core.},

  abstract = {Urban planning still lacks appropriate standards to define city boundaries across urban systems. This issue has historically been left to administrative criteria, which can vary significantly across countries and political systems, hindering a comparative analysis across urban systems. However, the wide use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has now allowed the development of new quantitative approaches to unveil how social dynamics relates to urban infrastructure. In fact, ICT provide the potential to portray more accurate descriptions of the urban systems based on the empirical analysis of millions of traces left by urbanites across the city. In this work, we apply computational techniques over a large volume of mobile phone records to define urban boundaries, through the analysis of travel patterns and the trajectory of urban dwellers in conurbations with more than 100,000 inhabitants in Chile. We created and analyzed the network of interconnected places inferred from individual travel trajectories. We then ranked each place using a spectral centrality method. This allowed to identify places of higher concurrency and functional importance for each urban environment. Urban scaling analysis is finally used as a diagnostic tool that allowed to distinguish urban from non-urban spaces. The geographic assessment of our method shows a high congruence with the current and administrative definitions of urban agglomerations in Chile. Our results can potentially be considered as a functional definition of the urban boundary. They also provide a practical implementation of urban scaling and data-driven approaches on cities as complex systems using increasingly larger non-conventional datasets.},

We use crowdsourced keywords from the Internet Movie Database as a window into the contents of films, and prescribe novelty scores for each film based on occurrence probabilities of individual keywords and keyword-pairs. These scores provide revealing insights into the dynamics of novelty in cinema. We investigate how novelty influences the revenue generated by a film, and find a relationship that resembles the Wundt-Berlyne curve. We also study the statistics of keyword occurrence and the aggregate distribution of keywords over a 100 year period.},

Although a determinant for the increase of knowledge, the heterogeneity of these studies may raise the issue of a systematic documentation of the key contributions in this field. In this context, the present research focuses on analyzing the scientific literature published in the last five years on the topic of ``green jobs'' with the aim to identify definitions and meanings associated with the concept of ``green jobs'', the connected terms, areas of research interest and the main theoretical and practical results. The results reveal that although there is no uniformity in the definition of the concept, there is still a convergence towards the initial meaning offered by the UNEP/ILO/IOE/ITUC Report of 2008. Moreover, using scientific software VOSViewer our research shows that the concept of ``green jobs'' is most linked with the following terms: sustainable development, the green economy, the circular economy, the welfare economy, the European Green Pact, energy, renewable energy, economic development, and employment. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the studies focused on ``green jobs'' are mainly concerned with the following issues: green jobs creation, work-life balance, correlations between green business and green jobs and the role of local government in supporting green jobs.},

Observations of urban{\textendash}rural air temperature differences{\textemdash}or urban heat islands (UHIs){\textemdash}have been reported for cities and regions worldwide, often with local field sites that are extremely diverse in their physical and climatological characteristics. These sites are usually described only as ``urban'' or ``rural,'' leaving much uncertainty about the actual exposure and land cover of the sites. To address the inadequacies of urban{\textendash}rural description, the ``local climate zone'' (LCZ) classification system has been developed. The LCZ system comprises 17 zone types at the local scale (102 to 104 m). Each type is unique in its combination of surface structure, cover, and human activity. Classification of sites into appropriate LCZs requires basic metadata and surface characterization.

  abstract = {Homophily and heterophobia, the tendency for people with similar characteristics to preferentially interact with (or avoid) each other are pervasive in human social networks. Here, we develop an extension of the mathematical theory of urban scaling which describes the effects of homophily and heterophobia on social interactions and resulting economic outputs of cities. Empirical tests of our model show that increased residential racial heterophobia and segregation in U.S. cities are associated with reduced economic outputs and that the strength of this relationship increased throughout the 2010s. Our findings provide the means for the formal incorporation of general homophilic and heterophobic effects into theories of modern urban science and suggest that racial segregation is increasingly and adversely impacting the economic performance and connectivity of urban societies in the U.S.},

Environmental sustainability of economic growth has come to be recognized as one of the most important pillars of sustainable growth and development. In order to tackle many challenges of the so-called green growth and sustainable development we try to build a new/alternative Green GDP indicator that should give us a clearer perspective of the consequences of economic progress by offering a new approach in quantifying the cost of ecological and environmental degradation. The indicator reviews economic growth through the environmental prism without speculating on how economic and social trends will evolve and how these developments will guide policy making in the years to come. We are well conscious that this indicator cannot ideally reflect the genuine status and improvement of national output, however, we see it as an attempt to encourage further discussions on the green growth in a diverse range of developing and developed countries. The results reveal a necessity for a new synergy between economic and environmental concepts, hence this study should be seen as an opportunity, not an obstacle for equitable and sustainable growth/development prospects.},

In an earlier paper, we addressed some of these debates by proposing a foundational concept of urbanisation and urban form as a way of identifying a common language for urban research. In the present paper we provide a brief recapitulation of that framework. We then use this preliminary material as background to a critique of three currently influential versions of urban analysis, namely, postcolonial urban theory, assemblage theoretic approaches and planetary urbanism. We evaluate each of these versions in turn and find them seriously wanting as statements about urban realities. We criticise (a) postcolonial urban theory for its particularism and its insistence on the provincialisation of knowledge, (b) assemblage theoretic approaches for their indeterminacy and eclecticism and (c) planetary urbanism for its radical devaluation of the forces of agglomeration and nodality in urban-economic geography.},

  abstract = {When estimating causal effects using observational data, it is desirable to replicate a randomized experiment as closely as possible by obtaining treated and control groups with similar covariate distributions. This goal can often be achieved by choosing well-matched samples of the original treated and control groups, thereby reducing bias due to the covariates. Since the 1970's, work on matching methods has examined how to best choose treated and control subjects for comparison. Matching methods are gaining popularity in fields such as economics, epidemiology, medicine, and political science. However, until now the literature and related advice has been scattered across disciplines. Researchers who are interested in using matching methods-or developing methods related to matching-do not have a single place to turn to learn about past and current research. This paper provides a structure for thinking about matching methods and guidance on their use, coalescing the existing research (both old and new) and providing a summary of where the literature on matching methods is now and where it should be headed.},

In addition to an introductory and a concluding part, the paper has four sections. The first of these, on measurement of income inequality, deals with preliminary concepts and definitions; a visual representation of inequality (the Lorenz curve); real-valued indices of inequality; properties of inequality indices; some specific inequality measures; and the relationship between Lorenz, welfare, and inequality orderings. The second section, on poverty, deals with the identification and aggregation exercises; properties of poverty indices; some specific poverty measures; the problem of plurality and unambiguous rankings; poverty measures and anti-poverty policy; and other issues in the measurement of poverty. The third section considers aspects of both congruence and conflict in the relationship amongst poverty, inequality, and welfare. The final substantive section advances the rationale for a more comprehensive assessment of human well- being than is afforded by the income perspective, it briefly reviews measurement concerns relating to generalized indices of deprivation and disparity, and it discusses the data and policy implications of the more expansive view of well-being adopted in the section. {\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nKeywords: inequality, disparity, poverty, deprivation, measurement, income, capability, functioning, well-being},

  abstract = {India changed its data sources and methodology for estimating real gross domestic product (GDP) for the period since 2011-12. This paper shows that this change has led to a significant overestimation of growth. Official estimates place annual average GDP growth between 2011-12 and 2016-17 at about 7 percent. We estimate that actual growth may have been about 4{$\frac{1}{2}$} percent with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3 {$\frac{1}{2}$} -5 {$\frac{1}{2}$} percent. The evidence, based on disaggregated data from India and cross-sectional/panel regressions, is robust. Lending further credence to the evidence, part of the over- estimation can be related to a key methodological change, which affected the measurement of the formal manufacturing sector. These findings alter our understanding of India's growth performance after the Global Financial Crisis, from spectacular to solid. Two important policy implications follow: the entire national income accounts estimation should be revisited, harnessing new opportunities created by the Goods and Services Tax to significantly improve it; and restoring growth should be the urgent priority for the new government.

  abstract = {Climate projections by the fossil fuel industry have never been assessed. On the basis of company records, we quantitatively evaluated all available global warming projections documented by{\textemdash}and in many cases modeled by{\textemdash}Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists between 1977 and 2003. We find that most of their projections accurately forecast warming that is consistent with subsequent observations. Their projections were also consistent with, and at least as skillful as, those of independent academic and government models. Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp also correctly rejected the prospect of a coming ice age, accurately predicted when human-caused global warming would first be detected, and reasonably estimated the ``carbon budget'' for holding warming below 2{\textdegree}C. On each of these points, however, the company's public statements about climate science contradicted its own scientific data.           ,              Insider knowledge                            For decades, some members of the fossil fuel industry tried to convince the public that a causative link between fossil fuel use and climate warming could not be made because the models used to project warming were too uncertain. Supran               et al               . show that one of those fossil fuel companies, ExxonMobil, had their own internal models that projected warming trajectories consistent with those forecast by the independent academic and government models. What they understood about climate models thus contradicted what they led the public to believe. {\textemdash}HJS                        ,              ExxonMobil's own climate models showed that fossil fuel use would cause climate warming.           ,                             BACKGROUND               In 2015, investigative journalists discovered internal company memos indicating that Exxon oil company has known since the late 1970s that its fossil fuel products could lead to global warming with ``dramatic environmental effects before the year 2050.'' Additional documents then emerged showing that the US oil and gas industry's largest trade association had likewise known since at least the 1950s, as had the coal industry since at least the 1960s, and electric utilities, Total oil company, and GM and Ford motor companies since at least the 1970s. Scholars and journalists have analyzed the texts contained in these documents, providing qualitative accounts of fossil fuel interests' knowledge of climate science and its implications. In 2017, for instance, we demonstrated that Exxon's internal documents, as well as peer-reviewed studies published by Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists, overwhelmingly acknowledged that climate change is real and human-caused. By contrast, the majority of Mobil and ExxonMobil Corp's public communications promoted doubt on the matter.                                         ADVANCES               Many of the uncovered fossil fuel industry documents include explicit projections of the amount of warming expected to occur over time in response to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Yet, these numerical and graphical data have received little attention. Indeed, no one has systematically reviewed climate modeling projections by any fossil fuel interest. What exactly did oil and gas companies know, and how accurate did their knowledge prove to be? Here, we address these questions by reporting and analyzing all known global warming projections documented by{\textemdash}and in many cases modeled by{\textemdash}Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp scientists between 1977 and 2003.               Our results show that in private and academic circles since the late 1970s and early 1980s, ExxonMobil predicted global warming correctly and skillfully. Using established statistical techniques, we find that 63 to 83\% of the climate projections reported by ExxonMobil scientists were accurate in predicting subsequent global warming. ExxonMobil's average projected warming was 0.20{\textdegree} {$\pm$} 0.04{\textdegree}C per decade, which is, within uncertainty, the same as that of independent academic and government projections published between 1970 and 2007. The average ``skill score'' and level of uncertainty of ExxonMobil's climate models (67 to 75\% and {$\pm$}21\%, respectively) were also similar to those of the independent models.                                Moreover, we show that ExxonMobil scientists correctly dismissed the possibility of a coming ice age in favor of a ``carbon dioxide induced `super-interglacial'''; accurately predicted that human-caused global warming would first be detectable in the year 2000 {$\pm$} 5; and reasonably estimated how much CO                 2                 would lead to dangerous warming.                                                        OUTLOOK               Today, dozens of cities, counties, and states are suing oil and gas companies for their ``longstanding internal scientific knowledge of the causes and consequences of climate change and public deception campaigns.'' The European Parliament and the US Congress have held hearings, US President Joe Biden has committed to holding fossil fuel companies accountable, and a grassroots social movement has arisen under the moniker \#ExxonKnew. Our findings demonstrate that ExxonMobil didn't just know ``something'' about global warming decades ago{\textemdash}they knew as much as academic and government scientists knew. But whereas those scientists worked to communicate what they knew, ExxonMobil worked to deny it{\textemdash}including overemphasizing uncertainties, denigrating climate models, mythologizing global cooling, feigning ignorance about the discernibility of human-caused warming, and staying silent about the possibility of stranded fossil fuel assets in a carbon-constrained world.

Finally, we also find that rural agriculture growth strongly reduces poverty in rural areas, the largest contributor to poverty in Indonesia.

Cost-effective renewable energy has largely been achieved, but there appear to be substantial barriers to building new renewable energy facilities. We identified 53 utility-scale wind, solar, and geothermal energy projects that were delayed or blocked between 2008 and 2021 in 28 U.S. states. Using multi-level qualitative analysis, we have identified seven key sources of opposition. Of the projects we studied, 34\% faced significant delays and diffi\- culties securing permits, 49\% were cancelled permanently, and 26\% resumed after being stopped for several months or years. Project delays and cancellations account for potential lost generating capacity of almost 4600 MW. State and local governments and renewable energy developers need to pay closer attention to the full range of socially-oriented sources of opposition to new facilities.},

It reviews the South African government's current and planned investment in urban infrastructure, both to enhance economic growth and to contribute to poverty reduction, and what this implies for Cape Town. It highlights the lack of attention given to ecological issues and the dangers of assuming that the resources will be available to support it, and that prices for fresh water, fossil fuels and food will not rise. It also points to Cape Town's large ecological footprint (comparable to that of Canada, per person) and its heavy dependence on non-renewable resources, especially oil - which means that every oil price rise transfers money from the Cape Town economy to national and global financial circuits. Housing lower-income groups in conventional housing with no attention to a more compact, less automobile-dependent city form exposes them to high water and energy costs. The paper ends by pointing to the advantages for the city and for lower-income groups of including ecological issues, and outlines the possibilities for doing so.

To address this challenge with respect to developing economies in the global South, this paper endeavours to fuse the core conceptual concerns of the developmental state and sustainability transition literatures. It is argued that a just transition would consist of a dual commitment to human well-being (with respect to income, education and health) and sustainability (with respect to decarbonization, resource efficiency and ecosystem restoration). However, to understand these processes we need a better understanding of political dynamics, and for this purpose the notion of a socio-political regime is introduced. A case study of South Africa's dual developmental and environmental trajectories is presented, revealing how different it is to the East Asian experience. Although a just transition in South Africa is currently unlikely, the rapid emergence of the renewable energy niche signals what may be possible if political and environmental shocks are experienced by key actors within the socio-political regime.},

Beyond some threshold, some cities disappear from the space-economy. Such an evolution of the urban system describes fairly well what has been observed in various historical periods that have experienced major changes in transportation technologies and/or political unification. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

This is predicted if the income differential is large enough. We also find that different income groups coexist in the same location for condominium prices. This is predicted if the income elasticity of demand for space is close to one and the pecuniary cost of commuting is zero.},

Social justice holds when inequality is responded to by rules that afford more primary goods, such as rights and incomes, to those who have less{\textemdash}the maximin principle of the Rawlsian social welfare function. Climate injustice consists in putting more climate bads, not primary goods, on those with slender shoulders{\textemdash}a maximin social ill-fare function. Cross-country climate injustice is a larger instance of this. The developed world has achieved much economic progress (including more primary goods) on the back of burning fossil fuels, which has put the planet on a heating curve that puts massive climate bads on lives and livelihoods today and in future. Most of these bads are put on the shoulders of developing countries. This work addresses within-country climate injustice, such as when persons with disability shoulder extra losses in capabilities, especially being without drinking water for 24 hours. The significant capability losses estimated to have been endured by persons with disability in Indonesia in 2018 and 2020 should inform a more enlightened and socially just response to climate injustice so that, along a just transition, few are harmed much, fewer still harmed too much.},

  abstract = {Incidents (vehicle breakdowns, crashes, roadworks, lane blockages, severe weather, etc.) are believed responsible for about 50 percent of traffic congestion in Australia's major cities, which is a similar situation to that found in cities in many other parts of the developed world. Incident-based congestion is particularly disruptive because of its random occurrence in space and time, which maximises the operational impacts of the congestion on social and economic activities. This paper discusses a method for assessing critical locations - congestion "hot spots" - in urban road networks, and the development and application of diagnostic tools that will allow urban road system managers to anticipate potential vulnerabilities to incident-related congestion and take proactive action to avoid congestion rather than react to it. The expected outcomes are then reduced congestion, delays, and pollution; significantly improved performance from the existing urban road system; and reduced pressure to build more roads. The method involves modelling of travel demand, network topology, capacity and road geometry, the identification and assessment of impacts of traffic incidents at specific locations in a road network, and the use of accessibility impact analysis to assess system-wide effects. Accessibility impact analysis is undertaken using an accessibility framework, which can account for time of day, transport mode and destination choices by individuals, and level of traffic congestion among other factors. A case-study application to a specific (potential) incident in a real-world network indicates that the proposed method is feasible and demonstrates its power in identifying not just total impacts but the distribution of those impacts across a region or community. While current approaches to urban road network planning and management tend to be reactive-finding cures for problems as they arise or addressing locations of recurrent congestion or bad incident record-the vulnerability analysis method described in the paper should lend itself to a proactive approach that can anticipate structural weaknesses and vulnerabilities and help to avoid or at least temper potential adverse effects, rather than to react to them afterwards. {\textcopyright} Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {In this article, we address why our management of the economy, community and business has led to global warming and we discuss the importance of worldviews, ontology, epistemology and axiology in the search for alternative paths of development. We do this by focusing on the concept of Circular Economy. Circular Economy is often presented as a solution to the problems of a globalized economy in the form of over-exploitation of resources, climate change and pollution of the environment. Within the mainstream economics paradigm, the aim is how to increase the effectiveness of resource extraction and utilization in order to maintain growth. We contrast this with the paradigm of Ecological Economics where the goal of the economy is to achieve and secure a higher quality of life. Circular Economy often side steps the deep ontological and epistemological questions we need to answer if we are to address the complex and interrelated environmental, economic and social problems we face today. This can be a limiting factor in the search for creative and long-term solutions. However, within the Circular Economy discourse, we find strands that critically engage with the foundations of mainstream Economics and so, innovative solutions for the society of the future are a possibility. We argue that to bring about a lasting solution to the interconnected social, economic and environmental problems, Circular Economy must engage with the ontological, epistemological and axiological foundations of mainstream economics. To further this argument, we apply Imre Lakatos' `research program' model to philosophy of science as our framework of analysis and draw lessons for business and communities.},

In these situations economic theory will make systematic errors in predicting behavior. Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory is proposed as the basis for an alternative descriptive theory. Topics discussed are: underweighting of opportunity costs, failure to ignore sunk costs, search behavior, choosing not to choose and regret, and precommitment and self-control.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONThis book is an attempt to uncover the main economic reasons for the existence of peaks and troughs in the spatial distributions of population and wealth. Economic activities are not concentrated on the head of a pin, nor are they spread evenly over a featureless plain. On the contrary, they are distributed very unequally across locations, regions, and countries, generating contour lines that vary with time and place. Just as matter in the solar system is concentrated in a small number of bodies (the planets and their satellites), economic life is concentrated in a fairly limited number of human settlements. Furthermore, paralleling large and small planets, there are large and small settlements with very different combinations of firms and households. Though universal, these phenomena are still in search of a general theory.The common belief, however, is that we now live in a world where the tyranny of distance, which has been such a powerful force in human history, no longer exists. The spectacular and steady drop in transport costs since the mid-nineteenth century, compounded by the decline of protectionism and, more recently, by the near disappearance of communication costs, is said to have freed economic agents from the need to be located near one another, suggesting that our economies are entering an age that will culminate in the ``death of distance.'' If so, locational difference would gradually fade because agglomeration forces would vanish. In other words, the combined impact of technology and globalization would make the traditional geography of economic activity obsolete and yesterday's world of peaks and troughs would miraculously become ``flat.''},

  abstract = {The Emergence of Cities in a Spatial EconomyINTRODUCTIONThus far, we have studied cities from several different perspectives, for they constitute the most visible and important facet of the phenomenon of economic agglomeration. However, we have left untouched one important issue, namely, the location of cities. Under the assumption of costless intercity trade, cities are like floating islands, and their location is irrelevant. For many purposes, this has been a convenient simplifying assumption. However, because the central concern of this book is to bring back space into economics in its many aspects and dimensions, we cannot end our quest without exploring the question of where cities are established, and why. More important, such issues are likely to be crucial for the future of our economies. In an increasingly borderless world economy, the location of prosperous and growing cities should increasingly become a critical factor in the determination of people's well-being.If the location of cities in the real world were arbitrary, it would be hopeless (and useless) to develop a theory about the location of cities. The reality, however, is quite the opposite. In fact, over the past century, economic geographers and historians have tirelessly advocated the surprising regularity in the actual structure of urban systems observed throughout the world, and so at different time periods (see, J. Marshall 1989, chapter 5; Hohenberg and Lees 1985, chapter 2).},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONWhen seeking a reason for the existence of cities, the one that comes most naturally to mind is the supply of public services. In large measure, this is dictated by historical considerations. For example, in medieval Europe cities were signified in two ways: a physical boundary (the walled city) and a legal status (the democratized city). Clearly, walling a city exhibits increasing returns and corresponds to a local public good whose supply is governed by size effects: the length of a circular wall is 2{$\pi$}r, whereas the size of the corresponding area is {$\pi$}r2; the ratio of the circumference to the area falls as the radius r increases, and thus a larger number of individuals may be defended at a lower average cost. In addition to its defensive purpose, the wall was also the symbol of the city's political autonomy, and the corporate freedom of the towns brought emancipation to individuals. Historians agree that the specific legal status, which may itself be interpreted as a local public good, was a major criterion for identifying the city at least until the end of the Middle Ages (Bairoch 1988, chapter 1), if not later on. This clear-cut separation no longer exists. The legal status has been homogenized, except for minor exceptions, in most nations. Urban activities have gradually extended beyond the physical boundaries of the city to create suburbs, which are now very much part of the city considered as an economic agglomeration. As a result, the modern city is more dispersed and has fuzzy boundaries.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONGlobalization is a multifaceted process. This chapter aims to address two of them that we consider as central for the future of our economies. Firstly, we build on the idea that knowledge spillovers are an important channel in the spatial diffusion of technological progress. Our goal is to understand how these spillovers affect the growth of various regions, especially through their spatial extent. Secondly, it is recognized that the contemporary and spectacular decrease in communication costs deeply affects the organization of firms through the spatial fragmentation of the supply chain. This in turn has a knock-on effect on the way the space-economy is organized. The common thread of this chapter therefore is to find out how the transfer of knowledge and information across space affects the location of economic activity. Note a major difference between spillover and communication: in the former, the information learned from others is the involuntary consequence of activities undertaken by some agents; in the latter, communication costs arise because geographically separated agents choose to exchange information.As seen in Chapter 8, market integration might well be accompanied by the appearance of some core regions whose wealth is, in part, obtained at the expense of peripheral regions: the average welfare in the region accommodating the manufacturing sector rises but it decreases in the other. So far, however, such a result has been obtained in the context of static models in which the total number of firms and varieties is constant.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONA higher density of economic activity typically means higher land rent and commuting costs for which workers must be compensated. For firms to pay them higher wages, they must derive some advantages from being agglomerated, e.g., within the CBD. The source of these advantages lies in the presence of various types of scale economies. As they take very different forms, they are likely to elude a superficial analysis. Increasing returns may be ``internal'' or ``external'' to firms. Internal scale economies are found in a wide variety of sectors. For example, they are characteristic of certain public services (e.g., large general hospitals and universities) as well as many private businesses in a range of sectors extending far beyond the heavy industries of the nineteenth century. These cases all involve firms' internal economies of scale, which, thanks to costly but efficiency-raising investments, provide incentive to concentrate production in a small number of plants or facilities. Increasing returns at the firm level are central to NEG (see Chapter 8) as well as to spatial competition theory (see Section 4.5).As seen in Chapter 2, a homogeneous space together with the competitive mechanism is not compatible with the existence of economic agglomerations such as cities. This is why we broached the assumption of homogeneity in Chapter 3 by assuming the existence of a prespecified center to which workers must commute. We did not, however, provide any justification for the existence of such a center.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONAt the interregional or international level, the spatial economy is replete with pecuniary externalities. For example, when workers choose to migrate, they bring with them both their production and consumption capabilities. As a result, their movements affect the size of labor and product markets in both the origin and destination regions. These effects have the nature of pecuniary externalities because migrating workers do not take them into account in their decisions. Pecuniary externalities are especially relevant when markets are imperfectly competitive because prices do not perfectly reflect the social values of individual decisions. The effects generated by migrations are better studied within a general equilibrium framework that accounts for the interactions between the product and labor markets. Among other things, this allows studying the dual role of individuals as workers and consumers. At first sight, this seems to be a formidable task. Yet, as shown by Krugman (1991b), several of these various effects can be combined and studied within a relatively simple general equilibrium model of monopolistic competition, which has come to be known as the core-periphery (CP) model.Recall that monopolistic competition a la Chamberlin (1933) involves consumers with a preference for variety (varietas delectat), whereas firms producing these varieties compete for a limited amount of resources because they face increasing returns. The prototype that has emerged from the industrial organization literature is the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) model developed by Dixit and Stiglitz (1977).},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONEver since Adam Smith, it is well known that market size matters for the division of labor, hence for economic development. In this chapter, we want to deal with a related, but different, idea, namely market size is one of the basic determinants of firms' choices of location. Both economists and geographers agree that a large market tends to increase the profitability of the firms established in it. First of all, in his location problem where a firm chooses the location minimizing the total transport costs it bears, Weber ([1909] 1927) showed that the market {\textendash} or input source {\textendash} that has a weight exceeding the weighted sum of the other markets and input sources is always the firm's optimal location. In the same vein, the gravity equation asserts that locations having a good access to large markets offer firms greater profit opportunities. The profitability of firms is further enhanced by increasing returns because the growth in their volume of production also generates a drop in their average production costs. As a result, it seems reasonable to expect larger markets to attract more firms than smaller markets. This idea agrees with market potential theory, as developed by the American geographer Harris (1954) according to which firms tend to locate where they have the best access to markets in which they can sell their product},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONAs a start, it is natural to ask the following question: To what extent is the competitive paradigm useful in understanding the main features of the economic landscape described in Chapter 1? The general competitive equilibrium model is indeed the benchmark used by economists when they want to study the market properties of an economic issue. Before proceeding, we should remind the reader that the essence of this model is that all trades are impersonal: When making their production or consumption decisions, economic agents need to know the price system only, which they take as given. At a competitive equilibrium, prices provide firms and consumers with all the information they need to know to maximize their profit and their utility.The most elegant and general model of a competitive economy is undoubtedly that developed by Kenneth Arrow, Gerard Debreu, and Lionel McKenzie. According to this model, the economy is formed by agents (firms and households) and by commodities (goods and services). A firm is characterized by a set of production plans, each production plan describing a possible input-output relation. A household is identified by a relation of preference, by a bundle of initial resources, and by shares in firms' profits. When both consumers' preferences and firms' technologies are convex, a price system (one price per commodity), a production plan for each firm, and a consumption bundle for each household exist that satisfy the following conditions at the prevailing prices:i. Supply equals demand for each commodity;ii. Each firm maximizes its profit subject to its production set; andiii. Each household maximizes her utility under her budget constraint defined by the value of her initial endowment and her shares in firms' profits. In other words, all markets clear while each agent chooses her most preferred action at the equilibrium prices.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONThe analysis developed in the previous chapter sheds light on the emergence of centers within a city. There, the emergence of an urban center crucially depends on the existence of nonmarket interactions (externalities) among agents and is typical of the formation of a CBD involving high-level activities. However, in the real world, we also frequently observe the formation of clusters of retailers selling similar goods (fashion clothes, restaurants, movie theaters, antiquity shops, and so on) or of employment centers in which different kinds of jobs are performed. In such cases, the agglomeration forces are created through market interactions between firms and consumers or workers. As seen in Chapter 2, for this to occur, one must consider increasing returns and imperfect competition. In this chapter, our purpose is to show how urban centers of different types, such as commercial areas or employment centers, may emerge under imperfect competition in the product or labor market. We will consider different market structures. The common thread of the various models considered here is that monopoly (or monopsony) power on the product (labor) market is needed for such agglomerations to emerge in equilibrium.In Section 7.2, we suppose monopolistic competition with a large number of firms selling a differentiated product to consumers who display a taste for variety (Fujita 1988). Firms no longer assume that they can sell whatever they want at given market prices. Instead, each firm is aware that its optimal choice (location and price) depends on the demand for the variety it supplies.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONThe most distinctive feature of a city is its much higher population density than the surrounding nonurban areas. As a result, economic agents residing within a city are close to one another. But why do households and firms seek spatial proximity? Fundamentally, this occurs because economic agents need to interact and distance is an impediment to interaction. This need is gravitational in that its intensity is likely to increase with the number of agents set up in each location and to decrease with the distance between two locations. This need has been at the heart of the work of several geographers, and we encounter it on many occasions and with different economic meanings.However, by crowding a few locations only, economic agents also decrease their satisfaction because they normally enjoy consuming more land, either as consumers or as producers. Therefore, one can view the agglomeration process, at least in the first order, as the interplay between an interaction field among agents and competition on the land market. In such a setting, the need to interact acts as a centripetal force, whereas competition for land has the nature of a centrifugal force. As is seen in this chapter, it is remarkable that the mere need to interact turns out to be sufficient to generate a single-peaked distribution of (homogeneous) agents across locations.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTIONLand use models explain the way various activities using land locate over a given area. This phenomenon can be studied from a different perspective by asking which activities are accommodated in specific locations. As seen in this chapter, these two approaches may be considered interchangeable, although they differ somewhat. The first is more in line with microeconomics in that the analysis focuses on where given agents chose to locate, whereas the second is more akin to the approach followed by many geographers, who put the emphasis on places and densities and not on agents.Because, in a market economy, land is allocated among activities through the price of land, the land use problem is equivalent to asking how the price of land is determined in a competitive economy. This does not seem to be a feasible task, for we have just seen that the price mechanism does not work in a spatial economy. The spatial impossibility theorem does not preclude, however, the possibility of uncovering particular, but relevant, economic situations in which the price mechanism is able to govern the allocation of activities over space. This is precisely what we try to do in this chapter.The prototype of such particular situations has been put forward by Thunen (1826), who sought to explain the pattern of agricultural activities surrounding cities in preindustrial Germany. His model relies on the following basic idea: each farmer faces a trade-off between land rents and transport costs.},

Both indices were conceived outside the field of linguistics but they both relate satisfactorily, on a conceptual basis, to lr which can then be defined as an absolute entity. Moreover, the use of whole frequency distributions will be regarded by some as a guarantee of quality. Yet, these indispensable virtues are, in both cases, blemished by some shortcomings which rule them out for a linguist. Instead of borrowing directly from other sciences, it might be useful to collaborate with mathematicians in order to elaborate an index of lr which would combine linguistic consistency and mathematical reliability. This would have the added advantage of making inevitable a theoretical reflexion on the very concept of lr, especially as regards its relations to the structure of frequency distributions. In this case it might be necessary to question some of our thinking concerning the vision of lr in relational terms. From an epistemological point of view, an interesting situation might arise where, in a given field (in this instance, linguistics), progress in theoretical thinking is made possible not by the automatic incorporation of elements from other fields, but by the critical (and hopefully positive) study of such tools. {\textcopyright} 1986 Paradigm Press, Inc.},

This may seem at first to be a trivial issue, since why else would a zoning board make the ordinance more restrictive. However, it is possible for landowners to circumvent the zoning law. For example, they can subdivide their land before the zoning change occurs. In addition, they can bargain with the local zoning officials and offer side payments, also known as exactions, for the right to develop their land. This paper examines a famous case of agricultural downzoning in McHenry County, Illinois. It finds that although the number of building permits issued did not fall immediately, in the long run the number of permits issued by the county was significantly reduced. This suggests that developers were able to anticipate the zoning change and subdivide their land before it occurred. {\textcopyright} 1997 Academic Press.},

This problem can be solved with an instrumental variables strategy derived from the internal logic of a structural model of residential sorting. We show practically how the strategy is implemented, provide intuition for the instruments and econometric identification, demonstrate how traditional techniques overstate agglomeration externalities, and use the model to value changes in spillovers from urban centers. {\textcopyright} Oxford University Press 2005; all rights reserved.},

Comprising different scales and typologies, NbS makes up a modern toolkit of actions towards decarbonized, climate-resilient, and ecologically healthy cities, claiming ample ecological, social, and economic benefits. A literature analysis indicates a greater presence of research and projects focused on NbS in countries in the Global North than in the South; however, given their accelerated urban growth, lack of green areas, and degradation of local environments, cities of the South urgently need such solutions. Nonetheless, research on the effects of urban greening agendas in the Global North has demonstrated that solutions may be entangled with neoliberal practices of space production that exacerbate inequalities, resulting in harmful social impacts such as displacement of people and increases in land and housing costs. This study seeks to build an anticipatory understanding of practices that articulate NbS in the Global South from a Brazilian viewpoint. Given Brazil's reality of social and environmental injustices, we focus on whether implementing NbS could amplify such problems. Our objective is to contribute to the debate by (1) under\- standing how the NbS concept is being appropriated, in practice, in Brazil, and (2) reflecting and pointing out paths and recommendations on how to plan NbS through a justice lens.},

These forces sharpen social segregation, which is reflected in fragmented social network structure. Geographical impediments such as distance and physical or administrative boundaries also reinforce social segregation. Yet, less is known about the joint relationships between social network structure, urban geography, and inequality. In this paper we analyze an online social network and find that the fragmentation of social networks is significantly higher in towns in which residential neighborhoods are divided by physical barriers such as rivers and railroads. Towns in which neighborhoods are relatively distant from the center of town and amenities are spatially concentrated are also more socially segregated. Using a two-stage model, we show that these urban geography features have significant relationships with income inequality via social network fragmentation. In other words, the geographic features of a place can compound economic inequalities via social networks.},

However, traditional 'narrative' reviews frequently lack thoroughness, and in many cases are not undertaken as genuine pieces of investigatory science. Consequently they can lack a means for making sense of what the collection of studies is saying. These reviews can be biased by the researcher and often lack rigour. Furthermore, the use of reviews of the available evidence to provide insights and guidance for intervention into operational needs of practitioners and policymakers has largely been of secondary importance. For practitioners, making sense of a mass of often-contradictory evidence has become progressively harder. The quality of evidence underpinning decision-making and action has been questioned, for inadequate or incomplete evidence seriously impedes policy formulation and implementation. In exploring ways in which evidence-informed management reviews might be achieved, the authors evaluate the process of systematic review used in the medical sciences. Over the last fifteen years, medical science has attempted to improve the review process by synthesizing research in a systematic, transparent, and reproducible manner with the twin aims of enhancing the knowledge base and informing policymaking and practice. This paper evaluates the extent to which the process of systematic review can be applied to the management field in order to produce a reliable knowledge stock and enhanced practice by developing context-sensitive research. The paper highlights the challenges in developing an appropriate methodology.},

  abstract = {The prevailing terminological confusion around the concept 'diversity' has hampered accurate communication and caused diversity issues to appear unnecessarily complicated. In fact, a consistent terminology for phenomena related to (species) diversity is already available. When this terminology is adhered to, diversity emerges as an easily understood concept. It is important to differentiate between diversity itself and a diversity index: an index of something is just a surrogate for the thing itself. The conceptual problem of defining diversity also has to be separated from the practical problem of deciding how to adequately quantify diversity for a community of interest. In practice, diversity can be quantified for any dataset where units of observation (such as individuals) have been classified into types (such as species). All that needs to be known is what proportion of the observed units belong to a type of mean abundance. Diversity equals the inverse of this mean, and it quantifies the effective number of the types of interest. In ecology, interest often (but not always) focuses on species diversity. If the dataset consists of (or gets divided into) subunits, then the total effective number of species (gamma diversity) can be partitioned into the effective number of compositionally distinct subunits (beta diversity) and the mean effective number of species per such subunit (alpha diversity). Species richness is related to species diversity, but they are not the same thing; richness does not take the proportional abundances into account and is therefore the actual-rather than the effective-number of types. Most of the phenomena that have been called 'beta diversity' in the past do not quantify an effective number of types, so they should be referred to by names other than 'diversity' (for example, species turnover or differentiation). {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Unfortunately, a large number of research studies have been identified as being nonreplicable along with having other shortcomings (low power, improper methodology, poor sample size) that reduce the rigor of a study's research findings. Additional techniques are needed beyond relying solely on a p value. The Solution: This article presents recommendations that Human Resource Development (HRD) scholars and scholar-practitioners can implement to improve the rigor of the discipline's research and practice. This article also provides guidelines (higher power, meta-analyses, low bias in large studies) of how to best avoid producing nonreplicability studies along with recommendations for the larger field, in this instance for scholars and scholar-practitioners in the social sciences. The Stakeholders: Scholars, scholar-practitioners, employees, and researchers who are impacted by changes in their environment due to less-than rigorous evidence-based research findings.},

The creation of large metropolitan municipalities was intended to accelerate socioeconomic development and urban restructuring in order to overcome the legacy of segregation and exclusion. This paper assesses their achievements, ten years on, using the concept of resilience as the analytical frame. Resilience helps to examine cities as interconnected systems open to external influences but with some capacity for self-organisation and learning. It is useful for exploring the coexistence of urban continuity and change. Evidence shows that the responses of South Africa city authorities to globalisation, urbanisation, and democracy have been circumscribed. Continuity and incremental change have been more evident than transformation and development. Hesitant progress exposes cities to the risk of greater social instability. Insights from resilience theory support the idea that enhanced municipal capabilities could facilitate a more enduring outcome. {\textcopyright} 2014 Pion and its Licensors.},

This is a crucial issue for low and middle income countries wrestling with burgeoning urban populations. The chapter first considers whether an urbanising population causes economic growth, but finds little evidence to support this. It argues instead that there is an interdependent relationship between urbanisation and development. Urbanisation is intimately bound up with the evolving dynamics of economic development, but it is not a separate driver of change. The relationship is also dependent on the context, including the composition of economic growth and the physical environment in which growth occurs.},

  abstract = {Purpose: This paper addresses the urban transit sector investigating variables affecting the habitual modal choices of commuters aiming to gain insight into the key factors affecting these choices and the reasons that discourage them from using public transport services. Methods: Probit and structural equation models have been estimated, while additional statistical analysis was performed to gain better insight of the commuters' mobility behavior. Results: The analysis showed that the main factor affecting the preference of commuters toward passenger car is the availability of parking space. A preference of female respondents towards public transport was also evident, while, compared to the other age groups, respondents between the ages of 35 and 44 show a higher preference for car. Furthermore, crowding is the factor that most discourages respondents from the use of public transport. High fare, lack of public transport information and bad accessibility to the transit network do not seem to discourage respondents' use of public transport in the particular situation that was analyzed in this research. Conclusions: The paper demonstrated how the results drawn from the analysis can be used for tactical and strategic planning. For example, the fact that high fare levels do not discourage commuters from using public transport, may allow policy makers to slightly increase fares and redirect additional revenue to improve other public transport services. Therefore, such findings may be quite useful for policy makers to better tackle commuters' perception and to define the appropriate urban mobility management actions and policies. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

It is necessary to distinguish the inside of cities from the outside when calculating the values of sustainability indicators that assess the impacts of human activities within cities on areas beyond their boundaries. For this purpose, spatial boundaries of cities should be practically detected on the basis of a relevant definition of a city. Although no definition of a city is commonly shared among academic fields, three practical methods for identifying urban areas are available in remote sensing science. Those practical methods are based on population density, landcover, and night-time lights. These methods are correlated, but non-negligible differences exist in their determination of urban extents and urban population. Furthermore, critical and statistically significant differences in some urban environmental sustainability indicators result from the three different urban detection methods. For example, the average values of CO2 emissions per capita and PM10 concentration in cities with more than 1 million residents are significantly different among the definitions. When analyzing city sustainability indicators and disseminating the implication of the results, the values based on the different definitions should be simultaneously investigated. It is necessary to carefully choose a relevant definition to analyze sustainability indicators for policy making. Otherwise, ineffective and inefficient policies will be developed.},

Development urbanism is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on sustainable urban development as a means to combat poverty and protect the environment in the so-called "developing" world. Based on his experiences teaching, researching and practicing in India, the author discusses some of the problems related to the urban transition of India, including the air pollution, the contamination and depletion of fresh water resources, the precarious food situation, the lack of proper housing, and various environmental and human health problems related to motorized transportation. He also proposes a number of possible solutions, including the use of plants and natural ventilation to create clean indoor air, the revitalization of an existing system of water canals, the creation of vertical kitchen gardens in a rehabilitation colony, a strategy for making an entire neighborhood car-free and a design for self-designed, low-cost housing.

The research joins the results agenda debate, arguing that in dealing with CD interventions, pre-defined indicators fail to represent the process and the key elements that take CD recipients toward patterns of change. The study highlights the fact that CD deals with projects that, by their nature (consisting of change processes designed to initiate change in people, organizations, and/or their enabling environment), rely more on non-planned changes than on the pre-defined indicators and results to contribute to livelihood improvements and social transformation. The study recognizes the difficulty of evaluating CD under straightforward mechanisms. It concludes that the existing approaches are not adequate to truly capture or measure impact, as CD projects, restricted by previously agreed budgets, resources, and time frames, are usually not designed to evaluate the sustainability of change and its impact over the medium or long term. As resources are scarce, donor agencies and policy-makers need to know the value of CD in order to best prioritize their investments. However, due to the nature of these projects, measuring the return rate between the project cost and its impact remains a difficult task. There is a need for new, multi-path approaches to capturing changes in capacity in order to serve as a basis for decision-making regarding CD investments.},

We show how it differs from ceteris paribus as "all other things being normal", which is used in contexts with preference defeaters. We provide a semantic analysis and several completeness theorems. We show how our system links up with Von Wright's work, and how it applies to game-theoretic solution concepts, to agenda setting in investigation, and to preference change. We finally consider its relation with infinitary modal logics.},

The former dominates the latter following a shift from a Fordist towards a finance and real-estate driven regime. A consequence is that existing manufacturing areas are increasingly transformed into residential and commercial areas. However, this conflicts with the rationale of CE, namely that to end the linear economy, externalized activities, such as the (re)manufacturing of waste, should be internalized again, especially within urban regions. Emphasized by the EU, The Netherlands have the ambition to become fully circular in 2050. To test our hypothesis, we focus on two ongoing circular area developments in Amsterdam and Utrecht. By performing a discourse-institutional analysis, we detect in both case studies a change in discourse towards CE. Our results show that in contrast to our hypothesis, the concept of circularity is not emphasizing the 'organization of space', but even accelerating 'space as a location', increasingly transforming urban industrial areas into circular built residential and commercial areas. We conclude with spatial policy recommendations regarding the ambitions of a future CE.},

In Qu{\'e}bec City, a medium-sized Canadian metropolitan area, commuting distances increased for both male and female workers between 1977 and 1996, while durations increased for male workers and decreased for female workers. This article seeks to identify spatial and social factors responsible for these changes. We develop a disaggregate model of trip duration estimated on the basis of large samples derived from travel surveys comparable through time. Using categorical variables to specify change, we are able to separate change effects from level effects attributable to various dimensions of urban form. Our analysis clearly indicates that, once travel mode and key social factors are controlled for, the shift from a monocentric to a dispersed city form is responsible, in the Qu{\'e}bec metropolitan area, for increasing commuting time. This is contrary to findings in larger metropolitan areas, where, it has been argued, the suburbanization of jobs maintains stability in commuting duration.},

While originating in the 1930s, CPT is a theoretical monument of 1960s spatial science. CPT aims to understand settlement geographies based on consumption behavior and is often presented as a singular, outdated, and rationalist theory. After critically reviewing the history of CPT, we assess the microfoundations of Christaller's CPT{\textendash}the threshold and range of goods{\textendash}for various central functions in Louisville, Kentucky. The microfoundations are estimated through data from social media platforms Foursquare and Twitter. These sources alleviate many of the operationalization issues that traditionally hamper empirical use of CPT. The empirical application of CPT reveals that: (i) central functions have typical ranges and thresholds relating central places to population spread; (ii) central functions cluster based on an approximate hierarchical structure. The findings indicate the ongoing importance of CPT in shaping urban-economic geographies.},

Since the initial emergence of colonization in South Africa racial prejudice and cultural segregation was evident and to date this phenomenon is still apparent in the major cities. This paper considers the idea of studying segregation and the potential promotion of future integrated development by the application of agent-based modelling to social and cultural interaction in the urban environment. 1. Introduction " In the absence of an indigenous urban tradition, South African cities were established by white settlers, who regarded the cities as their cultural domain. " (Lemon, 1991). To date, many researchers have pursued and deliberated the tumultuous past of the South African city and much has been published on the colonial occupation of Southern Africa and the consequences of racial and social segregation. The main objective of this paper is to provide an outline of my research {\textendash} a study of the complex dynamics of cultural interaction within the residential environment of Cape Town by the application of agent-based modelling. Firstly, background to the historical urban development and segregation of Cape Town is provided, followed by a brief discussion on the concept of segregation modelling and the possibilities it presents. Finally, a brief outline is presented of the methodology applied and the initial and simplified conceptual model constructed for studying the nature of segregation in the case study area. 2.

  abstract = {The Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) had a rapid demographic and urban growth during the second half of the twentieth century that led to development of an intense Urban Heat Island (UHI). In the urbanized zone, the mean maximum and minimum temperatures have had significant increases of the order of 3 and 4{\textdegree}C during the last one hundred years. Even more, the areas of larger mean annual temperature approximately match the urbanization patters, showing the MCMA UHI has expanded to the eastern {\textendash} northeastern and northwestern zones, along with the urbanization. There has also been a change in the precipitation regime over most of the city, since annual mean precipitation, for instance over the western part of the MCMA, has increased in almost 40\% during the last century. In summary, the natural hazards related to warm spells (maximum temperature {$>$} 30 {\textdegree}C) or intense storms (precipitation {$>$} 20 mm/day) have increased along with the UHI. When some factors of the MCMA vulnerability are considered (i.e., loss of natural vegetation), it is concluded that the urban growth of the region has led to higher climatic risk and to more negative impacts, such as urban floods.},

Conventional statistical and econometric techniques such as regression often work well, but there are issues unique to big datasets that may require different tools. First, the sheer size of the data involved may require more powerful data manipulation tools. Second, we may have more potential predictors than appropriate for estimation, so we need to do some kind of variable selection. Third, large datasets may allow for more flexible relationships than simple linear models. Machine learning techniques such as decision trees, support vector machines, neural nets, deep learning, and so on may allow for more effective ways to model complex relationships. In this essay, I will describe a few of these tools for manipulating and analyzing big data. I believe that these methods have a lot to offer and should be more widely known and used by economists.},

These studies have shown that the degree of functional polycentricity varies considerably across different spatial scales. Moreover, functional polycentricity is linked to two distinct concepts: spatial integration and the balanced distribution of flows. The aim of this paper is to clarify the relation between these two concepts and to highlight the implications of this conceptual distinction for empirical research across different scales. The paper examines the connectivity field method developed to measure spatial interaction in polycentric urban systems. Using detailed commuting data, the feasibility of the method in measuring both spatial integration and the balanced distribution of flows across different scales is tested in a case study from southern Finland. {\textcopyright} 2013 Royal Dutch Geographical Society KNAG.},

Looking at the wider regional structure, development can be associated with large shifts in the location of activity as industry goes from being inward looking to being export oriented. {\textcopyright} Oxford University Press 2005; all rights reserved.},

Such processes derive from spatially concentrated increasing returns to scale including thick market effects, knowledge spillovers, sectoral and urban clustering, and self-reinforcing improvements in physical and social infrastructure. These sources of agglomeration have been extensively analyzed in the economic geography literature. They imply that spatial unevenness in economic activity and incomes is an equilibrium outcome. Growth tends to be 'lumpy', with some sectors in some countries growing fast while other countries lag. The policy challenge is to lift potential new centers of economic activity to the point where they can reap the productivity and investment climate advantages of increasing returns and cumulative causation. {\textcopyright} 2009 African Development Bank.},

This paper conceptualizes this in a framework in which a city can produce non-tradable goods and {\textendash} if it is sufficiently competitive {\textendash} also internationally tradable goods, potentially subject to increasing returns to scale. A city is unlikely to produce tradables if it faces high urban and hinterland demand for non-tradables, or high costs of urban infrastructure and construction. The paper shows that, if there are increasing returns in tradable production, there may be multiple equilibria. The same initial conditions can support dichotomous outcomes, with cities either in a low-level (non-tradable only) equilibrium, or diversified in both tradable and non-tradable production. We demonstrate the importance of history and of expectations in determining outcomes. Essentially, a city can be built in a manner which makes it difficult to attract tradable production. This might be a consequence of low (and self-fulfilling expectations) or of history. Predictions of the model are consistent with a number of observed features of African cities.},

We start by de-bunking common misperceptions about the microeconomics of conflict and identify several contributions to economic theory and, in particular, to empirics, methods and data. We also show how the subfield is enriched through cooperation with scholars working in related disciplines. We expect future work to contribute inter alia to the evidence base on peacebuilding interventions, the development of post-conflict institutions, the behavior of firms in conflict areas and the role of emotions in decision-making. We note a disconnect between the rapidly evolving academic subfield on the one hand and the relatively limited use of knowledge thus generated by humanitarian and development organisations and policy makers working in and on conflict-affected areas. We conclude by suggesting that teaching in economics and the discipline-specific JEL codes have not yet kept pace with this recent intellectual development.},

  abstract = {With reference to assessing Circular Economy (CE) at the firm level, available literature reviews do not clarify what and how has to be actually assessed, while many assessment methods do not take into account the latest developments in the field. Furthermore, CE indicators are not explicitly linked to the firm's organizational functions involved in CE assessment. In order to address these issues and to favor practice-oriented CE assessments at the firm level, the present paper collects and analyses CE assessment indicators at their finest level of granularity, i.e. the CE metrics. By means of a systematic literature review, the work gathers insights from 130 documents belonging to scientific and practitioners' literature, reviews existing CE metrics, and organizes them according to a new circular Value Chain framework. More in details, 365 different firm-level metrics have been identified and classified through said circular Value Chain framework, articulated into 23 categories. The vast majority of CE metrics are sufficiently general and applicable in assessment procedures irrespective of the firm size, the geographic location, the industrial domain and the selling strategy of the company. This aspect facilitates the fine-tuning of comprehensive CE assessment methods, which, as a result, can largely neglect contingency factors of the investigated firms. The framework and its categories help match CE metrics and organizational functions, thus facilitating the individuation of firms' players involved in CE assessment. As the review highlights a remarkable fragmentation of current CE assessment models and diverging interpretations of CE's scopes, further implications on research and practice are discussed.},

The first postulate of a user-centred theory is that the built environment exists to support the activities of users that it shelters. This theory, therefore, indicates ways in which we might learn more about this complex relationship; it also provides tools for measuring the degree to which the built environment in use is successful. Ways of approaching the users' experience of built space, and ways of measuring it to ensure that knowledge of the user-environment relationship grows, are described. Challenges to implementing such an exploration include defining users, agreeing on the meaning of experience, and organising if not delimiting what is included in the notion of built environment. The temporal dimension of space use is also a consideration. Drawing on extensive research on space-use in office buildings, a viable user-centred theory is developed in the context of one type of built environment. The user-centred theory enables links to be made between knowledge accumulated both at the micro scale of the users' experience and at the macro perspective of how the built environment is produced and delivered.},

The following databases were consulted: Web of Knowledge, Ovid, Proquest, Wiley Online Library, Emerald, PsycNet, CAPES Database and Scielo. Fifty-One articles were analyzed. The results show that: (a) there is little agreement on how to measure training needs; (b) most of the current TNA models and methods are reactive and do not consider contextual factors and multiple levels of analysis in a proactive way; (c) there are gaps in TNA and a need for theoretical definitions; (d) there is little concern with building theories and concepts related to TNA. Based on these findings, we point out that TNA practice and research should: (a) be based exclusively on measurable human competences gaps, in multiple possible levels of analysis; (b) not focus only on individual professional roles, but also on internal and external contextual factors that can be important in the future; (c) discuss and criticize in depth what work needs, training needs and training needs assessment mean; (d) elaborate and test TNA theories, concepts, models and methods.

  abstract = {Cities and regions depend on resources and ecological services from distant ecosystems. The well-being of city and region residents is affected by both the health and availability of these ecosystems, especially in today's ecologically strained world. The management of a city or region's resource metabolism, including the natural capital that supports these flows, is becoming increasingly a central concern to cities and regions that want to succeed. Urban infrastructure is long-lasting and influences resource needs for decades to come: which cities are building future resource traps, and which are opportunities for resource-efficient and more competitive lifestyles? Reliable measures comparing the supply of natural capital to human demand are indispensable for managing resource metabolism, as they help identify challenges, set targets, track progress and drive policies for sustainability. This paper describes one such measurement tool: The Ecological Footprint. After explaining the assumptions behind the Footprint and describing some representative findings, it provides examples of how this resource accounting tool can assist local governments in managing their ecological assets, and support their sustainability efforts.

  abstract = {Poor data quality (DQ) can have substantial social and economic impacts. Although firms are improving data quality with practical approaches and tools, their improvement efforts tend to focus narrowly on accuracy. We believe that data consumers have a much broader data quality conceptualization than IS professionals realize. The purpose of this paper is to develop a framework that captures the aspects of data quality that are important to data consumers. A two-stage survey and a two-phase sorting study were conducted to develop a hierarchical framework for organizing data quality dimensions. This framework captures dimensions of data quality that are important to data consumers. Intrinsic DQ denotes that data have quality in their own right. Contextual DQ highlights the requirement that data quality must be considered within the context of the task at hand. Representational DQ and accessibility DQ emphasize the importance of the role of systems. These findings are consistent with our understanding that high-quality data should be intrinsically good, contextually appropriate for the task, clearly represented, and accessible to the data consumer. Our framework has been used effectively in industry and government. Using this framework, IS managers were able to better understand and meet their data consumers' data quality needs. The salient feature of this research study is that quality attributes of data are collected from data consumers instead of being defined theoretically or based on researchers' experience. Although exploratory, this research provides a basis for future studies that measure data quality along the dimensions of this framework. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1996 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.},

  abstract = {The quantification of spatial heterogeneity can be used to examine the structure of ecological systems. The 2008Wenchuan earthquake caused severe vegetation damage. In addition to simply detecting change, the magnitude of changes must also be examined. Remote sensing and geographic information system techniques were used to produce landscape maps before and after the earthquake and analyze the spatial-temporal change of the vegetation pattern. Landscape metrics were selected to quantify the spatial heterogeneity in a categorical map at both the class and landscape levels. The results reveal that the Wenchuan earthquake greatly increased the heterogeneity in the study area. In particular, forests experienced the most fragmentation among all of the landscape types. In addition, spatial heterogeneity in a numerical map was studied by using variogram analysis of normalized difference vegetation indices derived from Landsat images. In comparison to before the earthquake, the spatial variability after the earthquake had doubled. The structure of the spatial heterogeneity represented by the range of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) variograms also changed due to the earthquake. Moreover, the results of the NDVI variogram analysis of three contrasting landscapes, which were farmland, broadleaved forest, and coniferous forest, confirm that the earthquake produced spatial variability and changed the structure of the landscapes. Regardless of before or after the earthquake, farmland sites are the most heterogeneous among the three landscapes studied.},

Analysis of plant microremains recovered from the surfaces of Oc Eo grinding stone tools thought to be of South Asian origin has identified culinary spices that include turmeric, ginger, fingerroot, sand ginger, galangal, clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon. These spices are indispensable ingredients used in the making of curry in South Asia today.

Given past dominance of the global North in shaping planning theory and practice, this article argues that a perspective from the global South can be useful in unsettling taken-for-granted assumptions about how planning addresses these issues. The article takes a first step in this direction by proposing a 'clash of rationalities', between techno-managerial and marketised systems of government administration, service provision and planning (in those parts of the world where these apply) and increasingly marginalised urban populations surviving largely under conditions of informality. It draws together theoretical resources beyond the boundaries of conventional planning theory to understand the nature of this conflict, and the nature of the 'interface' between those involved, where unpredictable encounter and contestation also open the possibility for exploring alternative approaches to planning. {\textcopyright} 2009 Urban Studies Journal Limited.},

This essay reviews the relevance of three economic paradigms to the theory of development control. It is written as a technical review with the purpose of explaining, contrasting and contextualising the contributions of these paradigms. Much has been written about the Pigouvian case for regulative planning. The Coasian literature is strong especially in the US but is not so well known elsewhere; and little has been written that draws together the diverse perspectives offered by the public choice school. This essay has been written particularly for academic planners and urban social scientists in the UK, and in other European and Commonwealth countries who are not familiar with the technical arguments underlying the Coase vs Pigou zoning debate. It is also an essay on the public choice theory of planning since it contextualises Coasian planning theory within that wider critique of welfare economics. Among other points, it argues that the relevance of Coasian planning theory is not by any means restricted to US-style zoning, nor is it purely a debate about deregulation. Coasian and other public choice perspectives generate a rich source of theoretical and empirical propositions which should be tested and developed, particularly as frameworks for comparative analysis of planning constitutions and policies. In this spirit, the essay concludes with elements of a research agenda.},

  abstract = {A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components of a graphic. Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics (e.g., the "scatterplot") and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics. This article builds on Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman (2005), describing extensions and refinements developed while building an open source implementation of the grammar of graphics for R, ggplot2. The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The grammar is then presented formally and compared toWilkinson's grammar, highlighting the hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail. The article concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can build on the grammar to learn how to create graphical "poems." Supplemental materials are available online.

Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

  abstract = {Justice and fairness have become key considerations in sustainability pathways and nature-based solutions (NBS), following activists and critical scholars who have long argued that the urban environment is an inherently political space that requires an analysis of benefits and burdens associated with its existence, use, and access. However, what justice means and how it is expressed, recognized, or achieved is often implicit in the literature on NBS, even though underlying notions of justice shape the analysis done and actions proposed. This paper starts from the premise that justice knows many different interpretations, therefore warranting scholars and practitioners working on NBS to carefully consider the differences and frictions between competing meanings of justice. Drawing from the history of social and environmental justice theory, we give an account of some key justice dilemmas and discuss their tenets as it relates to the end, means, and participants in the making of justice. From this, we draw out questions and commitments academics and practitioners in the NBS space should grapple with more explicitly. We argue that the emergent tension between pragmatic policy approaches and critical theoretical engagement is hindering a version of NBS that goes beyond a reflection of the justice implications of NBS to ensuring that NBS contributes to the furthering of justice. We advocate for the inclusion of critical social sciences and humanities perspectives and approaches beyond tokenism to instead encourage ontological, epis\- temological, and political reflection of the work academics and practitioners do in the NBS space.},

It will also help to address urban problems including resource security, waste disposal, greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, heating, drought and flooding. Taking a circular approach can also tackle many other socio-economic problems afflicting cities, for example, providing access to affordable accommodation, expanding and diversifying the economic base, building more engaged and collaborative communities in cities. Thus it has great potential to improve our urban living environments. To date, the industrial ecologists and economists have tended to dominate the circularity debate, focusing on closed-loop industrial systems and circular economy (circular businesses and systems of provision). In this paper I investigate why the current state-ofthe-art conceptualisation for circular economy (RESOLVE) is inadequate when applied to a city. Through this critique and a broader review of the literature I identify the principles and components which are lacking from the circular economy (CE) conceptualisation when applied to a city. I then use this to develop my own definition and conceptualisation of a circular approach to urban resource management.},

The end result will be healthier urban ecosystems, with low levels of resource consumption and wastage. Spatial planning potentially has a crucial role to play in the delivery of circular development. However, it has an ambiguous legacy, demonstrated by London, Paris and Amsterdam. It will need to go beyond the allocation of temporary spaces for circular experi\- mentation, if it is to enable the transition. It will need to intervene in markets to provide space for low-value, circular activities and enable the localised looping of resources within city-regions. It should support infrastructure needed for circular actions and ensure urban form continues to support circular systems adopted. Finally, planners can generate demand for circular activities and products, through conditions placed on new developments.},

Largely ignored in these discussions are methods for ordinal variables that are natural extensions of probit and logit models for dichotomous variables. If ordinal variables are discrete realizations of unmeasured continuous variables, these methods allow one to include ordinal dependent and independent variables into structural equation models in a way that (I) explicitly recognizes their ordinality, (2) avoids arbitrary assumptions about their scale, and (3) allows for analysis of continuous, dichotomous, and ordinal variables within a common statistical framework. These models rely on assumed probability distributions of the continuous variables that underly the observed ordinal variables, but these assumptions are testable. The models can be estimated using a number of commonly used statistical programs. As is illustrated by an empirical example, ordered probit and logit models, like their dichotomous counterparts, take account of the ceiling andfloor restrictions on models that include ordinal variables, whereas the linear regression model does not.

  abstract = {The urbanization of the world, which is one of the most impressive facts of modern times, has wrought profound changes in virtually every phase of social life. The recency and rapidity of urbanization in the United States accounts for the acuteness of our urban problems and our lack of awareness of them. Despite the dominance of urbanism in the modern world we still lack a sociological definition of the city which would take adequate account of the fact that while the city is the characteristic locus of urbanism, the urban mode of life is not confined to cities. For sociological purposes a city is a relatively large, dense, and permanent settlement of heterogeneous individuals. Large numbers account for individual variability, the relative absence of intimate personal acquaintanceship, the segmentalization of human relations which are largely anonymous, superficial, and transitory, and associated characteristics. Density involves diversification and specialization, the coincidence of close physical contact and distant social relations, glaring contrasts, a complex pattern of segregation, the predominance of formal social control, and accentuated friction, among other phenomena. Heterogeneity tends to break down rigid social structures and to produce increased mobility, instability, and insecurity, and the affiliation of the individuals with a variety of intersecting and tangential social groups with a high rate of membership turnover. The pecuniary nexus tends to displace personal relations, and institutions tend to cater to mass rather than to individual requirements. The individual thus becomes effective only as he acts through organized groups. The complicated phenomena of urbanism may acquire unity and coherence if the sociological analysis proceeds in the light of such a body of theory. The empirical evidence concerning the ecology, the social organization, and the social psychology of the urban mode of life confirms the fruitfulness of this approach.},

With a view to amounting sustainability deficits, urban stakeholders thus require transformative capacity to perform radical change within and across the multiple socio-ecological and socio-technical systems embedded in cities. However, existing (transformative) 'capacity' concepts refer to distinct subjects and purposes and do not adequately address the particularities of urban contexts and/or practical operationalization. Therefore, this paper suggests an integrated conceptual framework for developing 'urban transformative capacity', drawing on contributions from a range of research areas. It identifies 10 key components and a range of factors that describe the forms of agency and interaction, development processes and relational dimensions involved in building up urban transformative capacity, emphasizing the vital role of place and scale in this. It thus establishes a baseline and direction for capacity growth. This allows recognizing the particular requirements and assets of diverse types of cities and urban contexts in the global North and South, and offers strategic orientation for urban policy making, planning practice and research.},

In some situations, particularly in the context of clustering, the model-based approach can suffer from ambiguity, and can lead to standard errors that are systematically biased. A combination of the design-based and sampling-based approaches requires the researcher to think about the variation in key explanatory variables when computing standard errors, and it can even apply to cases where the entire population is observed.},

  volume = {25},

  pages = {367--380},
  abstract = {The large number of components, nonlinear interactions, time delays and feedbacks, and spatial heterogeneity together often make ecological systems overwhelmingly complex. This complexity must be effectively dealt with for understanding and scaling. Hierarchy theory suggests that ecological systems are nearly completely decomposable (or nearly decomposable) systems because of their loose vertical and horizontal coupling in structure and function. Such systems can thus be sim- plified based on the principle of time-space decomposition. Patch dynamics provides a powerful way of dealing explicitly with spatial heterogeneity, and has emerged as a unifying concept across different fields of earth sci- ences. The integration between hierarchy theory and patch dynamics has led to the emergence of the hierarchical patch dynamics paradigm (HPDP). In this paper, I shall dis- cuss some major elements of ecological com- plexity, hierarchy theory, and hierarchical patch dynamics, and then present a hierarchi- cal scaling strategy. The strategy consists of three stages, each of which may involve a number of steps and methods: (1) identifying appropriate patch hierarchies, (2) making ob- servations and developing models of patterns and processes around focal levels, and (3) ex- trapolation across the domains of scale using a hierarchy of models. Identifying and tak- ing advantage of the hierarchical structure and near-decomposability of complex eco- logical systems are essential to understanding and prediction because a hierarchical ap- proach can greatly facilitate simplification and scaling. It is hardly justifiable theoreti- cally and overwhelmingly difficult technically to translate information directly between two distant levels (or corresponding scales), when ignoring intervening levels that are relevant to the phenomenon under study. Although it may be possible to scale up from the cell to globe, or vice versa, successful approaches most likely have to be hierarchical. In this paper I shall describe one of such approaches in which patch hierarchies are used as scal- ing ladders. This scaling ladder approach can help simplify the complexity of systems under study, enhance ecological understand- ing, and, in the same time, minimize the dan- ger of intolerable error propagation in trans- lating information across multiple scales},

  abstract = {Although a successfully built environment has been widely accepted in urban planning as a method of promoting urban vitality in China, the related theories were proposed in Western cities, and these have not been empirically verified in Chinese cities, especially in high-density urban areas. The availability of mobile phone location data has made it possible to accurately measure urban vitality and explore the influence mechanism of built environments in China's high-density urban areas. In this study, the intensity of urban activity was used as a proxy for urban vitality and its value was calculated during six time periods of the day using active mobile phone location data in the central urban area of Shanghai, China. Subsequently, the variables were confirmed within the built environment according to classical theories, and values were assigned to these indicators based on topographic and survey maps. Furthermore, after a series of tests, six spatial econometric models were created to evaluate the impact of the built environment on urban vitality. The results demonstrated that active mobile phone location data can reflect and help measure urban vitality to a great extent. Mixed use and diversity, scale, old buildings, density, and border vacuums all contributed to the urban vitality of Chinese high-density urban areas; meanwhile, density and proximity to public facilities were the most significant. In addition, compared to working time, urban vitality was more susceptible to the built environment during nonworking times.},

These three methodologies have previously been used separately or in pairs to simulate land use change. In this paper, we apply them in combination, using ant colony optimization and cellular automata to manage the spatial distribution of land use, and applying Markov chain and cellular automata to manage the total amount of land use coverage. We first describe the principle and implementation of the model. Then a land use map of an experimental area (Changping, a district of Beijing) based on land use maps from 1988 and 1998 is simulated for 2008 using the model. By analyzing with real situation, accuracy of the simulation result manifests that the model is useful for land use change simulation. And compared with the other two models (CA-Markov model and ACO-CA model), the model is more appropriate in predicting both the quantity and spatial distribution of land use change in the study area. Therefore the model proposed by this paper is capable of simulating land use change. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

  abstract = {Urban climate adaptation through nature-based solutions (NBS) requires collective action that incorporates spatial justice considerations. Collective actions reveal new ways of thinking about urban green commons and spatial justice by reframing conventional understandings of NBS, space, and climate adaptation. Three urban green commons examined in Istanbul demonstrate how the grassroots-supported NBS must navigate complex land ownership arrangements, spatial justice, and opposing urban development priorities and socio-spatial reconfigurations spurred by local and national political elites. Using qualitative data collected from fieldwork carried out in 2019, we find critical relationships between activists, academics, professional organizations, and local residents collectively acting to promote urban green commons. NBS do not rely on the dominant technopolitical processes that generate primarily infrastructure-based climate adaptation solutions in Istanbul. While spatial justice and collective action scholarship often pays attention to how disadvantaged communities gain recognition and involvement in decision making - such as establishing formal channels to access environmental goods and services - climate adaptation through NBS opens spaces of opportunity for these groups to promote justice and resist the dominant economic development paradigm. Further studies must pay attention to what extent collective actions create new socio-political identities that are harnessed to resist dominant technopolitical processes, and when are these emergent identities co-opted by local and national governments.},

Although increasingly perceived as fundamental socio-economic units, the detailed fabric of urban economic activities is only recently accessible to comprehensive analyses with the availability of large datasets. Here, we study abundances of business categories across US metropolitan statistical areas, and provide a framework for measuring the intrinsic diversity of economic activities that transcends scales of the classification scheme. A universal structure common to all cities is revealed, manifesting self-similarity in internal economic structure as well as aggregated metrics (GDP, patents, crime).We present a simple mathematical derivation of the universality, and provide a model, together with its economic implications of open-ended diversity created by urbanization, for understanding the observed empirical distribution. Given the universal distribution, scaling analyses for individual business categories enable us to determine their relative abundances as a function of city size. These results shed light on the processes of economic differentiation with scale, suggesting a general structure for the growth of national economies as integrated urban systems.},

Geographic Information System (GIS) is used to acquire spatial samples and perform spatial analysis. The NR method and GA are utilized, respectively, to estimate the coefficients that maximize the likelihood of the spatial logistic regression model. Both methods are compared in terms of the maximum likelihood and computing time. The experimental results show that the NR method can achieve a better likelihood and is also much faster than the GA method. Therefore, the NR method is recommended for estimating a spatial logistic regression model although GA can also be employed.},

  abstract = {Urban morphology is examined in various disciplines as it is associated with a range of ecological, social, and economic sustainable outcomes. Yet there is a lack of clarity and consensus on measuring urban morphology indicators that will allow interdisciplinary scholarship at a city, regional, or global scale for integrated sus\- tainable solutions. This systematic review aims to 1) develop a taxonomy of measures of urban form indicators linked to sustainable outcomes spanning environmental, economic, and social dimensions, 2) systematically summarize the quantitative methods used to analyze urban morphology-sustainability relationships, 3) identify existing research trends, gaps, and future research directions for sustainable urban morphology studies. Based on the 89 systematically searched and synthesized articles, we identified 365 unique metrics of urban morphology with a wide variability of names, operational definitions, and data used. We provided a list of these metrics classified into six aspects (i.e., urban tissue configuration, street network, building-plot characteristics, land use, natural features and greenspace, and urban growth) and their sub-categories, highlighting the most used metrics. Even though urban morphology is inherently a spatial concept, considerations of spatial models in understanding urban morphology-sustainability relationships were limited. Synthesizing nine groups of sustainable outcomes further informed that future studies should focus more on the natural features and ecosystem health of cities. This review recommended adopting a consistent classification scheme in measuring, quantifying, and assessing urban forms in relation to sustainable outcomes to facilitate interdisciplinary research as an important step to finding solutions for achieving environmental, social, and economic sustainable outcomes worldwide.},
